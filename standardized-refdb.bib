  abstract      = {Using classical molecular dynamics simulations, we study ion−ion interactions in water. We study the potentials of mean force (PMF) for the full set of alkali halide ion pairs, and in each case, we test different parameter sets for modeling both the water and the ions. Altogether, we compared 300 different PMFs. We also calculate association equilibrium constants (KA) and compare them to two types of experiments. Of additional interest here was the proposition of Collins called the “law of matching water affinities”, where the relative affinity of ions in solution depends on the matching of cation and anion sizes. From observations on the relative depths of the free energies of the contact ion pair (CIP) and the solvent-shared ion pair (SIP), along with related solvent structure analyses, we find a good correlation with this proposition: small−small and large−large should associate in water, and small−large should be more dissociated.},

	Abstract = {Constrained molecular dynamics simulations have been used to investigate the LiCl and NaCl ionic association in water in terms of atom-bond electronegativity equalization method fused into molecular mechanics (ABEEM/MM). The simulations make use of the seven-site fluctuating charge and flexible ABEEM-7P water model, based on which an ion-water interaction potential has been constructed. The mean force and the potential of mean force for LiCl and NaCl in water, the charge distributions, as well as the structural and dynamical properties of contact ion pair dissociation have been investigated. The results are reasonable and informative. For LiCl ion pair in water, the solvent-separated ion pair configurations are more stable than contact ion pair configurations. The calculated PMF for NaCl in water indicates that contact ion pair and solvent-separated ion pair configurations are of comparable stability.},

Here, we start from the realization that four enhanced sampling methods, metadynamics and well-tempered metadynamics (in their extended Lagrangian form), as well as driven adiabatic free energy dynamics (dAFED) and unified free energy dynamics (UFED), can be used in combination with any of the three above-mentioned FES estimators. We compare the convergence properties of these estimators on the alanine dipeptide and a sodium ion solvation shell. We find that the mean force estimator is superior in all cases. We also show that it can be marginally beneficial to combine information from the histogram and the force, provided that both are of comparable accuracy.},

We introduce a composite strategy that adds machine learning corrections to computationally inexpensive approximate legacy quantum methods. After training, highly accurate predictions of enthalpies, free energies, entropies, and electron correlation energies are possible, for significantly larger molecular sets than used for training. For thermochemical properties of up to 16k isomers of C7H10O2 we present numerical evidence that chemical accuracy can be reached. We also predict electron correlation energy in post Hartree–Fock methods, at the computational cost of Hartree–Fock, and we establish a qualitative relationship between molecular entropy and electron correlation. The transferability of our approach is demonstrated, using semiempirical quantum chemistry and machine learning models trained on 1 and 10% of 134k organic molecules, to reproduce enthalpies of all remaining molecules at density functional theory level of accuracy.},

The constraint-force method is employed to enhance sampling over the entire range of the reaction coordinate (Ca–Cl distance) from 2.2 to 6.5 Å. Particular attention is paid to equilibration of the system as it is found that the potential of mean force is highly sensitive to the hydration number of the Ca2 + ion. The structure and polarization of hydration waters are examined in detail at three ion-ion separations of interest: the contact-ion position, the solvent-separated-ion position, and the transition state between them. The ab initio results are compared to the classical ones obtained using the CHARMM force field and the parameters of Dang and Smith. There are substantial differences between the polarization of hydration waters of Ca2 + and Cl− ions at all distances, which indicates that an accurate description of Ca–Cl dissociation with nonpolarizable force fields may not be feasible. The ab initio results presented here for the Ca–Cl ion pair complements our earlier results for Na–Cl, and together they provide useful benchmarks for polarizable force fields under construction.},

We explored the sensitivity of the ion-pairing phenomena to the details of descriptions of molecular interaction, comparing two empirical potentials to explicit quantum based density functional theory. We find quantitative differences in the potentials of mean force for ion-pairing as well as time dependent frictions that lead to variations in the rate constant and reactive flux correlation functions. These details reflect differences in solvent response to ion-pairing between different representations of molecular interaction and influence anharmonicity of the dynamic response. We find that the short-time anharmonic response is recovered with a GLE parametrization. Recovery of the details of long time response may require extensions to the reduced model. We show that the utility of using a reduced model leads to a straightforward application of variational transition state theory concepts to the condensed phase system. The significance of this is reflected in the analysis of committor distributions and the variation of planar hypersurfaces, leading to an improved understanding of factors that determine the rate of LiF ion-pairing.},

In these theories, an effective choice of a reaction coordinate to describe a reaction pathway is essential. To this end, we study ion solvation in water using molecular dynamics simulations and explore the utility of coordination number (n = number of water molecules in the first solvation shell) as the reaction coordinate. Here, we compute the potential of mean force (W(n)) using umbrella sampling, predicting multiple metastable n-states for both cations and anions. With increasing ionic size, we find these states become more stable and structured for cations when compared to anions. We have extended transition state theory (TST) to calculate transition rates between n states. TST overestimates the rate constant due to solvent-induced barrier recrossings that are not accounted for. We correct the TST rates by calculating transmission coefficients using the reactive flux method. This approach enables a new way of understanding rare events involving coordination complexes.},

Besides finding differences in the free-energy for both ion-pairing and the coordination number of ion solvation between the quantum and classical descriptions of interaction, there were important differences found between dispersion corrected and uncorrected density functional theory (DFT). Specifically, we show significantly different free-energy landscapes for both coordination number of Ca2+ and its ion-pairing with Cl– depending on the DFT simulation protocol. Our findings produce a self-consistent treatment of short-range solvent response to the ion and the intermediate to long-range collective response of the electrostatics of the ion–ion interaction to produce a detailed picture of ion-pairing that is consistent with experiment.},

  abstract      = {Constrained molecular dynamics simulations were carried out to investigate the lithium chloride ionic associations in dilute aqueous solutions over a wide temperature range. Solvent mediated potentials of mean force have been carefully calculated at different thermodynamic conditions. Two intermediate states of ionic association can be well identified with an energy barrier from the oscillatory free energy profile. Clear pictures for the microscopic association structures are presented with a remarkable feature of strong hydration effect of lithium ion and the bridging role of its hydrating complex. Experimental association constants have been reasonably reproduced and a general trend of the increasing ionic association at high temperatures and low densities was observed. Additional simulations with different numbers of water molecules have been performed to check the possible artifacts introducing from periodic and finite size effects and confirm the reliability of our simulation results. Marginal differences of the simulated curves are believed to result from the significant compensation and canceling effect between the bare ionic forces and solvent induced mean force. Finally we confirmed the importance of accurate descriptions of dielectric properties of solvent in the ionic association study.},

Using the ultrafast T-jump, we examined this process, specifically the transformation of aqua cobalt (II) complexes to their fully halogenated species. The results reveal a stepwise mechanism with time scales varying from hundreds of picoseconds to nanoseconds. The dynamics are significantly faster when the structure is retained but becomes rate-limited when the octahedral-to-tetrahedral structural change bottlenecks the transformation. Evidence is presented, from bimolecular kinetics and energetics (enthalpic and entropic), for a reaction in which the ligand assists the displacement of water molecules, with the retention of the entering ligand in the activated state. The reaction time scale deviates by one to two orders of magnitude from that of ionic diffusion, suggesting the involvement of a collisional barrier between the ion and the much larger complex.},

Since its first appearance, significant improvements have been made to the original algorithm, leading to an efficient, flexible, and accurate method that has found many successful applications in several domains of science. Here, we discuss first the theory underlying metadynamics and its recent developments. In particular, we focus on the crucial issue of choosing an appropriate set of CVs and on the possible strategies to alleviate this difficulty. Later in the second part, we present a few recent representative applications, which we have classified into three main classes: solid-state physics, chemical reactions, and biomolecules.},

Most schemes use the final bias as their best estimate of the free energy surface. We show that large gains in computational efficiency, as measured by the reduction of time to solution, can be obtained by separating the bias used for dynamics from the final free energy reconstruction itself. We find that biasing with metadynamics, measuring a free energy gradient estimator, and reconstructing using Gaussian process regression can give an order of magnitude reduction in computational cost.},

TAMD is used to rapidly sweep through the important regions of the free energy landscape and to compute the gradient of the free energy locally at points in these regions. The variational method is then used to reconstruct the free energy globally from the mean force at these points. The algorithmic aspects of the single-sweep method are explained in detail, and the method is tested on simple examples and used to compute the free energy of the solvated alanine dipeptide in two and four dihedral angles.},

The effect of pH was considered by studying the exchange processes for [Al(H2O)6]3+ and its conjugated base, [Al(H2O)5OH]2+. Both complexes were found to exchange water in a dissociative way with activation energies (EA) of 15.9 and 10.2 kcal/mol, respectively. The influence of solvent molecules on the gas-phase cluster model was considered by the addition of up to four water molecules to the model system. The stabilizing effect of the solvent on the transition state decreases EA to 8.6 (hexa-aqua complex) and 7.6 (monohydroxo complex) kcal/mol, whereas EA for all hydroxo species is consistently significantly lower than those for the related aqua systems, which indicates a much faster water exchange rate. For the hydroxo complex, all calculated five-coordinate intermediates, nH2O·[Al(H2O)4(OH)]2+ (n = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5), are more stable than the corresponding six-coordinate reactants. Our results therefore suggest the presence of a stable five-coordinate species of aquated Al(III), namely, the [Al(H2O)4(OH)]2+ complex.},

In water, the D3h symmetry of NO3– is broken, and the degeneracy of the asymmetric-stretch modes is lifted. This provides a very sensitive probe of the ion–water interactions. The 2D-IR measurements reveal excitation exchange between the two nondegenerate asymmetric-stretch vibrations on a 300-fs time scale concomitant with fast anisotropy decay of the diagonal-peak signals. The MD simulations show that this is caused by jumps of the transition dipole orientations related to fluctuations of the hydrogen bonds connecting the nitrate ion to the nearest water molecules. Reorientation of the ion, which is associated with the hydrogen-bond breaking, was monitored by time-resolved UV–IR and UV–UV spectroscopy, revealing a 2-ps time constant. These time scales are very similar to those reported for isotope-labeled water, suggesting that NO3–(aq) has a labile hydration shell.},

The potentials of mean force for Cl-, Br-, and I- have shallow minima near the surface. We demonstrate that these minima derive from more favorable water–water interaction energy when the ions are partially desolvated. Alkali cations are on the inside because of the favorable ion–water energy, whereas F- is driven inside by entropy. Models attempting to explain the surface preference based on one or more ion properties such as polarizability or size are shown to lead to qualitative and quantitative errors, prompting a paradigm shift in chemistry away from such simplifications.},

Given their importance, there is need for systematic methods that effectively identify CVs for complex systems. In recent years, nonlinear manifold learning has shown its ability to automatically characterize molecular collective behavior. Unfortunately, these methods fail to provide a differentiable function mapping high-dimensional configurations to their low-dimensional representation, as required in enhanced sampling methods. We introduce a methodology that, starting from an ensemble representative of molecular flexibility, builds smooth and nonlinear data-driven collective variables (SandCV) from the output of nonlinear manifold learning algorithms. We demonstrate the method with a standard benchmark molecule, alanine dipeptide, and show how it can be non-intrusively combined with off-the-shelf enhanced sampling methods, here the adaptive biasing force method. We illustrate how enhanced sampling simulations with SandCV can explore regions that were poorly sampled in the original molecular ensemble. We further explore the transferability of SandCV from a simpler system, alanine dipeptide in vacuum, to a more complex system, alanine dipeptide in explicit water.},

The sum of Gaussians is exploited for reconstructing iteratively an estimator of the free energy and forcing the system to escape from local minima. This review is intended to provide a comprehensive description of the algorithm, with a focus on the practical aspects that need to be addressed when one attempts to apply metadynamics to a new system: (i) the choice of the appropriate set of collective variables; (ii) the optimal choice of the metadynamics parameters and (iii) how to control the error and ensure convergence of the algorithm.},

The formula applies to simulations in which the selected coordinates are either unconstrained or constrained to fixed values. It is shown that in the latter case the formula reduces to the expression previously derived by den Otter and Briels [Mol. Phys. 98, 773 (2000)]. If simulations are carried out without constraining the coordinates of interest, the formula leads to a new method for calculating the free energy changes along these coordinates. This method is tested in two examples — rotation around the C–C bond of 1,2-dichloroethane immersed in water and transfer of fluoromethane across the water-hexane interface. The calculated free energies are compared with those obtained by two commonly used methods. One of them relies on determining the probability density function of finding the system at different values of the selected coordinate and the other requires calculating the average force at discrete locations along this coordinate in a series of constrained simulations. The free energies calculated by these three methods are in excellent agreement. The relative advantages of each method are discussed.},

This was done so as to persuade a molecular system to visit new areas of conformational space rather than be confined to a small number of low-energy regions. The method is demonstrated on a simple model system and the 11-residue cyclic peptide cyclosporin A. For comparison, calculations were also performed using simulated temperature annealing and a potential energy annealing scheme. Although the method can only be applied to systems with a small number of degrees of freedom, it offers the chance to generate a multitude of different low-energy structures, where other methods only give a single one or few. This is clearly important in problems such as drug design, where one is interested in the conformational spread of a system.},

  abstract = {We develop an efficient sampling and free energy calculation technique within the adaptive biasing potential (ABP) framework. By mollifying the density of states we obtain an approximate free energy and an adaptive bias potential that is computed directly from the population along the coordinates of the free energy. Because of the mollifier, the bias potential is “nonlocal”, and its gradient admits a simple analytic expression. A single observation of the reaction coordinate can thus be used to update the approximate free energy at every point within a neighborhood of the observation. This greatly reduces the equilibration time of the adaptive bias potential. This approximation introduces two parameters: strength of mollification and the zero of energy of the bias potential. While we observe that the approximate free energy is a very good estimate of the actual free energy for a large range of mollification strength, we demonstrate that the errors associated with the mollification may be removed via deconvolution. The zero of energy of the bias potential, which is easy to choose, influences the speed of convergence but not the limiting accuracy. This method is simple to apply to free energy or mean force computation in multiple dimensions and does not involve second derivatives of the reaction coordinates, matrix manipulations nor on-the-fly adaptation of parameters. For the alanine dipeptide test case, the new method is found to gain as much as a factor of 10 in efficiency as compared to two basic implementations of the adaptive biasing force methods, and it is shown to be as efficient as well-tempered metadynamics with the postprocess deconvolution giving a clear advantage to the mollified density of states method.},

The second method relies on thermodynamic integration of the average force and is called the adaptive biasing force method [Darve and Pohorille, J. Chem. Phys. 115, 9169 (2001)]. Both methods are designed such that the system evolves along the chosen coordinate(s) without experiencing free energy barriers and they require calculating the instantaneous, unconstrained force acting on this coordinate using the formula derived by Darve and Pohorille. Efficiencies are analyzed by comparing analytical estimates of statistical errors and by considering two numerical examples—internal rotation of hydrated 1,2-dichloroethane and transfer of fluoromethane across a water-hexane interface. The efficiencies of both methods are approximately equal in the first but not in the second case. During transfer of fluoromethane the system is easily driven away from equilibrium and, therefore, the performance of the method based on Jarzynski’s identity is poor.},

  abstract = {New protein parameters are reported for the all-atom empirical energy function in the CHARMM program. The parameter evaluation was based on a self-consistent approach designed to achieve a balance between the internal (bonding) and interaction (nonbonding) terms of the force field and among the solvent−solvent, solvent−solute, and solute−solute interactions. Optimization of the internal parameters used experimental gas-phase geometries, vibrational spectra, and torsional energy surfaces supplemented with ab initio results. The peptide backbone bonding parameters were optimized with respect to data for N-methylacetamide and the alanine dipeptide. The interaction parameters, particularly the atomic charges, were determined by fitting ab initio interaction energies and geometries of complexes between water and model compounds that represented the backbone and the various side chains. In addition, dipole moments, experimental heats and free energies of vaporization, solvation and sublimation, molecular volumes, and crystal pressures and structures were used in the optimization. The resulting protein parameters were tested by applying them to noncyclic tripeptide crystals, cyclic peptide crystals, and the proteins crambin, bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor, and carbonmonoxy myoglobin in vacuo and in crystals. A detailed analysis of the relationship between the alanine dipeptide potential energy surface and calculated protein φ, χ angles was made and used in optimizing the peptide group torsional parameters. The results demonstrate that use of ab initio structural and energetic data by themselves are not sufficient to obtain an adequate backbone representation for peptides and proteins in solution and in crystals. Extensive comparisons between molecular dynamics simulations and experimental data for polypeptides and proteins were performed for both structural and dynamic properties. Energy minimization and dynamics simulations for crystals demonstrate that the latter are needed to obtain meaningful comparisons with experimental crystal structures. The presented parameters, in combination with the previously published CHARMM all-atom parameters for nucleic acids and lipids, provide a consistent set for condensed-phase simulations of a wide variety of molecules of biological interest.},

  abstract = {Molecular dynamics simulations of ionic solutions depend sensitively on the force fields employed for the ions. To resolve the fine differences between ions of the same valence and roughly similar size and in particular to correctly describe ion-specific effects, it is clear that accurate force fields are necessary. In the past, optimization strategies for ionic force fields either considered single-ion properties (such as the solvation free energy at infinite dilution or the ion-water structure) or ion-pair properties (in the form of ion-ion distribution functions). In this paper we investigate strategies to optimize ionic force fields based on single-ion and ion-pair properties simultaneously. To that end, we simulate five different salt solutions, namely, CsCl, KCl, NaI, KF, and CsI, at finite ion concentration. The force fields of these ions are systematically varied under the constraint that the single-ion solvation free energy matches the experimental value, which reduces the two-dimensional {σ,ε} parameter space of the Lennard-Jones interaction to a one dimensional line for each ion. From the finite-concentration simulations, the pair potential is extracted and the osmotic coefficient is calculated, which is compared to experimental data. We find a strong dependence of the osmotic coefficient on the force field, which is remarkable as the single-ion solvation free energy and the ion-water structure remain invariant under the parameter variation. Optimization of the force field is achieved for the cations Cs+ and K+, while for the anions I− and F− the experimental osmotic coefficient cannot be reached. This suggests that in the long run, additional parameters might have to be introduced into the modeling, for example by modified mixing rules.},

  abstract = {Unique among small molecules, water forms a nearly tetrahedral yet flexible hydrogen-bond network. In addition to its flexibility, this network is dynamic: bonds are formed or broken on a picosecond time scale. These unique features make probing the local structure of water challenging. Despite the challenges, there is intense interest in developing a picture of the local water structure due to water’s fundamental importance in many fields of chemistry.Understanding changes in the local network structure of water near solutes likely holds the key to unlock problems from analyzing parameters that determine the three dimensional structure of proteins to modeling the fate of volatile materials released into the atmosphere. Pictures of the local structure of water are heavily influenced by what is known about the structure of ice. In hexagonal Ih ice, the most stable form of solid water under ordinary conditions, water has an equal number of donor and acceptor bonds; a kind of symmetry. This symmetric tetrahedral coordination is only approximately preserved in the liquid. The most obvious manifestation of this altered tetrahedral bonding is the greater density in the liquid compared with the solid. Formation of an interface or addition of solutes further modifies the local bonding in water.Because the O–H stretching frequency is sensitive to the environment, vibrational spectroscopy provides an excellent probe for the hydrogen-bond structure in water. In this Account, we examine both local interactions between water and small solutes and longer range interactions at the aqueous surface. Locally, the results suggest that water is not a symmetric donor or acceptor, but rather has a propensity to act as an acceptor. In interactions with hydrocarbons, action is centered at the water oxygen. For soluble inorganic salts, interaction is greater with the cation than the anion. The vibrational spectrum of the surface of salt solutions is altered compared with that of neat water. Studies of local salt-water interactions suggest that the picture of the local water structure and the ion distribution at the surface deduced from the surface vibrational spectrum should encompass both ions of the salt.},

Conversely, for Ca2+Ca2+ the free-energy curve shows several shallow local minima, suggesting that the hydration structure of Ca2+Ca2+ is highly variable.

A series of constrained simulations was carried out at 300 K for up to 16 ps each, with the internuclear separation (rAl–Cl) between the Al3+ ion and one of the Cl– ions held constant. The calculated potential of mean force (PMF) of the Al3+–Cl– ion pair shows a global minimum at rAl–Cl = 2.3 Å corresponding to a contact ion pair (CIP). Two local minima assigned to solvent-separated ion pairs (SSIPs) are identified at rAl–Cl = 4.4 and 6.0 Å. The positions of the free energy minima coincide with the hydration-shell intervals of the Al3+ cation, suggesting that the Cl– ion is inclined to reside in regions with low concentrations of water molecules, that is, between the first and second hydration shells of Al3+ and between the second shell and the bulk. A detailed analysis of the solvent structure around the Al3+ and Cl– ions as a function of rAl–Cl is presented. The results are compared to structural data from X-ray measurements and unconstrained CPMD simulations of single Al3+ and Cl– ions and AlCl3 solutions. The dipole moments of the water molecules in the first and second hydration shells of Al3+ and in the bulk region and those of Cl– ions were calculated as a function of rAl–Cl. Major changes in the electronic structure of the system were found to result from the removal of Cl– from the first hydration shell of the Al3+ cation. Finally, two unconstrained CPMD simulations of aqueous AlCl3 solutions corresponding to CIP and SSIP configurations were performed (17 ps, 300 K). Only minor structural changes were observed in these systems, confirming their stability.},

Folded RNA molecules play key roles in almost every aspect of cellular metabolism, including protein transport, RNA splicing, peptide bond formation, and translational regulation. This is facilitated by the multifunctional nature of RNA biopolymers which can serve as rigid structural scaffolds, conformational switches, and catalysts for chemical reactions. In all cases, metal ions play a crucial role in RNA function. For folded RNA molecules, the pathway for adopting proper tertiary structure, and the stabilization of that structure, depends on specific and nonspecific interactions with certain classes of metal ions. There is a rapidly expanding repertoire of RNA structural motifs that typically sequester metal ions, and these are being studied using new spectroscopic and chemical methodologies. Many ribozymes (catalytic RNA molecules) depend on metal ions as cofactors that are explicitly involved in the chemical mechanism of catalysis. All of these functions are exemplified by recent studies of group II introns, which are among the largest ribozymes found in Nature. In this case, there are specific roles for metal ions in the folding pathway, the tertiary structure and the chemical mechanism.},

  abstract = {Intrinsically disordered regions of proteins can gain structure by binding to a partner. This process, of coupled folding and binding (CFaB), is a fundamental part of many important biological processes. Structure-based models have proven themselves capable of revealing fundamental aspects of how CFaB occurs, however, typical methods to enhance the sampling of these transitions, such as replica exchange, do not adequately sample the transition state region of this extremely rare process. Here, we use a variant of Umbrella Sampling to enforce sampling of the transition states of CFaB of HdeA monomers at neutral pH, an extremely rare process that occurs over timescales ranging from seconds to hours. Using high resolution sampling in the transition state region, we cluster states along the principal transition path to obtain a detailed description of coupled binding and folding for the HdeA dimer, revealing new insight into the ensemble of states that are accessible to client recognition. We then demonstrate that exchanges between umbrella sampling windows, as done in previous work, significantly improve relaxation in variables orthogonal to the restraints used. Altogether, these results show that Window-Exchange Umbrella Sampling is a promising approach for systems that exhibit flexible binding, and can reveal transition state ensembles of these systems in high detail. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Here, we introduce a mathematical framework that casts the step of combining the data as an eigenproblem. The advantage to this approach is that it facilitates error analysis. We discuss how the error scales with the number of windows. Then, we derive a central limit theorem for averages that are obtained from umbrella sampling. The central limit theorem suggests an estimator of the error contributions from individual windows, and we develop a simple and computationally inexpensive procedure for implementing it. We demonstrate this estimator for simulations of the alanine dipeptide and show that it emphasizes low free energy pathways between stable states in comparison to existing approaches for assessing error contributions. Our work suggests the possibility of using the estimator and, more generally, the eigenvector method for umbrella sampling to guide adaptation of the simulation parameters to accelerate convergence.},

  abstract = {Advances in hardware and algorithms have greatly extended the timescales accessible to molecular simulation. This article assesses whether such long timescale simulations improve our ability to calculate order parameters that describe conformational heterogeneity on ps-ns timescales or if force fields are now a limiting factor. Order parameters from experiment are compared with order parameters calculated in three different ways from simulations ranging from 10 ns to 100 μs in length. Importantly, bootstrapping is employed to assess the variability in results for each simulation length. The results of 10–100 ns timescale simulations are highly variable, possibly explaining the variation in levels of agreement between simulation and experiment in published works examining different proteins. Fortunately, microsecond timescale simulations improve both the accuracy and precision of calculated order parameters, at least so long as the full exponential fit or truncated average approximation is used instead of the common long-time limit approximation. The improved precision of these long timescale simulations allows a statistically sound comparison of a number of modern force fields, such as Amber03, Amber99sb-ILDN, and Charmm27. While there is some variation between these force fields, they generally give very similar results for sufficiently long simulations. The fact that so much simulation is required to precisely capture ps-ns timescale processes suggests that extremely extensive simulations are required for slower processes. Advanced sampling techniques could aid greatly, however, such methods will need to maintain accurate kinetics if they are to be of value for calculating dynamical properties like order parameters.},

  abstract = {Metadynamics (MTD) is a powerful enhanced sampling method for systems with rugged energy landscapes. It constructs a bias potential in a predefined collective variable (CV) space to overcome barriers between metastable states. In bias-exchange MTD (BE-MTD), multiple replicas approximate the CV space by exchanging bias potentials (replica conditions) with the Metropolis–Hastings (MH) algorithm. We demonstrate that the replica-exchange rates and the convergence of free energy estimates of BE-MTD are improved by introducing the infinite swapping (IS) or the Suwa-Todo (ST) algorithms. Conceptually, IS and ST perform transitions in a replica state space rather than exchanges in a replica condition space. To emphasize this, the proposed scheme is called the replica state exchange MTD (RSE-MTD). Benchmarks were performed with alanine polypeptides in vacuum and water. For the systems tested in this work, there is no significant performance difference between IS and ST.},

  abstract = {Atomistic simulations play a central role in many fields of science. However, their usefulness is often limited by the fact that many systems are characterized by several metastable states separated by high barriers, leading to kinetic bottlenecks. Transitions between metastable states are thus rare events that occur on significantly longer timescales than one can simulate in practice. Numerous enhanced sampling methods have been introduced to alleviate this timescale problem, including methods based on identifying a few crucial order parameters or collective variables and enhancing the sampling of these variables. Metadynamics is one such method that has proven successful in a great variety of fields. Here we review the conceptual and theoretical foundations of metadynamics. As demonstrated, metadynamics is not just a practical tool but can also be considered an important development in the theory of statistical mechanics.},

There are, however, collective variables, which can be constructed with only basic knowledge about the system studied, that provide an opportunity to alleviate this issue. We simulated two different reacting systems where two types of such collective variables (SPRINT coordinates and the collective variable-driven hyperdynamics method) were biased following the infrequent metadynamics method in order to recover the rates of reactions. We demonstrate that both generic collective variables are capable of reproducing the reaction rates of both systems and can enhance the efficiency of the simulation when compared to typical collective variables.},

Calculating an energy landscape of a process that depends on three or more reaction coordinates requires extensive computational power, making some multidimensional calculations practically impossible. Here, we present an efficient automatized umbrella sampling strategy for calculating a multidimensional potential of mean force. The method progressively learns by itself, through a feedback mechanism, which regions of a multidimensional space are worth exploring and automatically generates a set of umbrella sampling windows that is adapted to the system. The self-learning adaptive umbrella sampling method is first explained with illustrative examples based on simplified reduced model systems and then applied to two nontrivial situations: the conformational equilibrium of the pentapeptide Met-enkephalin in solution and ion permeation in the KcsA potassium channel. With this method, it is demonstrated that a significant smaller number of umbrella windows needs to be employed to characterize the free energy landscape over the most relevant regions without any loss in accuracy.},

While the method works very effectively when the number of order parameters is small, its computational cost grows rapidly in higher dimension. Here, we present a simple and efficient alternative strategy, which avoids solving the self-consistent WHAM equations iteratively. An efficient multivariate linear regression framework is utilized to link the biased probability densities of individual umbrella windows and yield an unbiased global free energy landscape in the space of order parameters.

  abstract = {Metadynamics (MTD) is a very powerful technique to sample high-dimensional free energy landscapes, and due to its self-guiding property, the method has been successful in studying complex reactions and conformational changes. MTD sampling is based on filling the free energy basins by biasing potentials and thus for cases with flat, broad, and unbound free energy wells, the computational time to sample them becomes very large. To alleviate this problem, we combine the standard Umbrella Sampling (US) technique with MTD to sample orthogonal collective variables (CVs) in a simultaneous way. Within this scheme, we construct the equilibrium distribution of CVs from biased distributions obtained from independent MTD simulations with umbrella potentials. Reweighting is carried out by a procedure that combines US reweighting and Tiwary–Parrinello MTD reweighting within the Weighted Histogram Analysis Method (WHAM). The approach is ideal for a controlled sampling of a CV in a MTD simulation, making it computationally efficient in sampling flat, broad, and unbound free energy surfaces. This technique also allows for a distributed sampling of a high-dimensional free energy surface, further increasing the computational efficiency in sampling. We demonstrate the application of this technique in sampling high-dimensional surface for various chemical reactions using ab initio and QM/MM hybrid molecular dynamics simulations. Further, to carry out MTD bias reweighting for computing forward reaction barriers in ab initio or QM/MM simulations, we propose a computationally affordable approach that does not require recrossing trajectories.},

  abstract = {The weighted histogram analysis method (WHAM) is widely used to obtain accurate free energies from biased molecular simulations. However, WHAM free energies can exhibit significant errors if some of the biasing windows are not fully equilibrated. To account for the lack of full equilibration, we develop the dynamic histogram analysis method (DHAM). DHAM uses a global Markov state model to obtain the free energy along the reaction coordinate. A maximum likelihood estimate of the Markov transition matrix is constructed by joint unbiasing of the transition counts from multiple umbrella-sampling simulations along discretized reaction coordinates. The free energy profile is the stationary distribution of the resulting Markov matrix. For this matrix, we derive an explicit approximation that does not require the usual iterative solution of WHAM. We apply DHAM to model systems, a chemical reaction in water treated using quantum-mechanics/molecular-mechanics (QM/MM) simulations, and the Na+ ion passage through the membrane-embedded ion channel GLIC. We find that DHAM gives accurate free energies even in cases where WHAM fails. In addition, DHAM provides kinetic information, which we here use to assess the extent of convergence in each of the simulation windows. DHAM may also prove useful in the construction of Markov state models from biased simulations in phase-space regions with otherwise low population.},

By the use of Boltzmann-weighted sums over states generated from a classical ensemble, the free energy difference between the classical and ab initio ensembles is readily available without the need for time-consuming integration over molecular dynamics trajectories. Convergence and errors in this scheme are discussed and characterised in terms of a quantity representing the degree of misfit between the classical and ab initio systems. Smaller but still substantial efficiency gains over molecular dynamics are also demonstrated for the calculation of average properties such as pressure and total energy for systems in equilibrium.},

  abstract = {Many problems in biology, chemistry, and materials science require knowledge of saddle points on free energy surfaces. These saddle points act as transition states and are the bottlenecks for transitions of the system between different metastable states. For simple systems in which the free energy depends on a few variables, the free energy surface can be precomputed, and saddle points can then be found using existing techniques. For complex systems, where the free energy depends on many degrees of freedom, this is not feasible. In this paper, we develop an algorithm for finding the saddle points on a high-dimensional free energy surface “on-the-fly” without requiring a priori knowledge the free energy function itself. This is done by using the general strategy of the heterogeneous multi-scale method by applying a macro-scale solver, here the gentlest ascent dynamics algorithm, with the needed force and Hessian values computed on-the-fly using a micro-scale model such as molecular dynamics. The algorithm is capable of dealing with problems involving many coarse-grained variables. The utility of the algorithm is illustrated by studying the saddle points associated with (a) the isomerization transition of the alanine dipeptide using two coarse-grained variables, specifically the Ramachandran dihedral angles, and (b) the beta-hairpin structure of the alanine decamer using 20 coarse-grained variables, specifically the full set of Ramachandran angle pairs associated with each residue. For the alanine decamer, we obtain a detailed network showing the connectivity of the minima obtained and the saddle-point structures that connect them, which provides a way to visualize the gross features of the high-dimensional surface.},

With these methods, it is found that ion pairing is not a rare phenomenon only occurring for very particular, strongly interacting cations and anions. Instead, for many salt solutions and their interfaces, the measured and calculated structure and dynamics reveal the presence of a distinct concentration of contact ion pairs (CIPs), solvent shared ion pairs (SIPs), and solvent-separated ion pairs (2SIPs).

In this article, we address the challenges (1) of obtaining fast and accurate solutions of the coupled nonlinear WHAM equations, (2) of quantifying the statistical errors of the resulting free energies, (3) of diagnosing possible systematic errors, and (4) of optimally allocating of the computational resources. Traditionally, the WHAM equations are solved by a fixed-point direct iteration method, despite poor convergence and possible numerical inaccuracies in the solutions. Here, we instead solve the mathematically equivalent problem of maximizing a target likelihood function, by using superlinear numerical optimization algorithms with a significantly faster convergence rate. To estimate the statistical errors in one-dimensional free energy profiles obtained from WHAM, we note that for densely spaced umbrella windows with harmonic biasing potentials, the WHAM free energy profile can be approximated by a coarse-grained free energy obtained by integrating the mean restraining forces. The statistical errors of the coarse-grained free energies can be estimated straightforwardly and then used for the WHAM results. A generalization to multidimensional WHAM is described. We also propose two simple statistical criteria to test the consistency between the histograms of adjacent umbrella windows, which help identify inadequate sampling and hysteresis in the degrees of freedom orthogonal to the reaction coordinate. Together, the estimates of the statistical errors and the diagnostics of inconsistencies in the potentials of mean force provide a basis for the efficient allocation of computational resources in free energy simulations.},

  abstract = {Parallel in time simulation algorithms are presented and applied to conventional molecular dynamics (MD) and ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) models of realistic complexity. Assuming that a forward time integrator, f (e.g., Verlet algorithm), is available to propagate the system from time ti (trajectory positions and velocities xi = (ri, vi)) to time ti + 1 (xi + 1) by xi + 1 = fi(xi), the dynamics problem spanning an interval from t0…tM can be transformed into a root finding problem, F(X) = [xi − f(x(i − 1)]i = 1, M = 0, for the trajectory variables. The root finding problem is solved using a variety of root finding techniques, including quasi-Newton and preconditioned quasi-Newton schemes that are all unconditionally convergent. The algorithms are parallelized by assigning a processor to each time-step entry in the columns of F(X). The relation of this approach to other recently proposed parallel in time methods is discussed, and the effectiveness of various approaches to solving the root finding problem is tested. We demonstrate that more efficient dynamical models based on simplified interactions or coarsening time-steps provide preconditioners for the root finding problem. However, for MD and AIMD simulations, such preconditioners are not required to obtain reasonable convergence and their cost must be considered in the performance of the algorithm. The parallel in time algorithms developed are tested by applying them to MD and AIMD simulations of size and complexity similar to those encountered in present day applications. These include a 1000 Si atom MD simulation using Stillinger-Weber potentials, and a HCl + 4H2O AIMD simulation at the MP2 level. The maximum speedup (
serialexecutiontime
parallelexecutiontime
 
) obtained by parallelizing the Stillinger-Weber MD simulation was nearly 3.0. For the AIMD MP2 simulations, the algorithms achieved speedups of up to 14.3. The parallel in time algorithms can be implemented in a distributed computing environment using very slow transmission control protocol/Internet protocol networks. Scripts written in Python that make calls to a precompiled quantum chemistry package (NWChem) are demonstrated to provide an actual speedup of 8.2 for a 2.5 ps AIMD simulation of HCl + 4H2O at the MP2/6-31G* level. Implemented in this way these algorithms can be used for long time high-level AIMD simulations at a modest cost using machines connected by very slow networks such as WiFi, or in different time zones connected by the Internet. The algorithms can also be used with programs that are already parallel. Using these algorithms, we are able to reduce the cost of a MP2/6-311++G(2d,2p) simulation that had reached its maximum possible speedup in the parallelization of the electronic structure calculation from 32 s/time step to 6.9 s/time step.},

This is a first mechanism that supports formation on ice as well as on liquid water surfaces. Results of ab initio molecular dynamics simulations are presented on collisions of CO2 with (H2O)n clusters (n = 1, 4, 8, 12). Efficient formation of carbonic acid is seen with product lifetimes exceeding 100 ps. The reaction is feasible even for collision of CO2 with a single water molecule but in a different mechanism than for larger clusters. For clusters, the transition state shows charge separation into H3O+···HCO3–, which transforms into neutral carbonic acid as the product, hydrated by the remaining waters.

  abstract  = {The calculation of free-energy differences is one of the main challenges in computational biology and biochemistry. Umbrella sampling, biased molecular dynamics (MD), is one of the methods that provide free energy along a reaction coordinate. Here, the method is derived in a historic overview and is compared with related methods like thermodynamic integration, slow growth, steered MD, or the Jarzynski-based fast-growth technique. In umbrella sampling, bias potentials along a (one- or more-dimensional) reaction coordinate drive a system from one thermodynamic state to another (e.g., reactant and product). The intermediate steps are covered by a series of windows, at each of which an MD simulation is performed. The bias potentials can have any functional form. Often, harmonic potentials are used for their simplicity. From the sampled distribution of the system along the reaction coordinate, the change in free energy in each window can be calculated. The windows are then combined by methods like the weighted histogram analysis method or umbrella integration. If the bias potential is adapted to result in an even distribution between the end states, then this whole range can be spanned by one window (adaptive-bias umbrella sampling). In this case, the free-energy change is directly obtained from the bias. The sampling in each window can be improved by replica exchange methods; either by exchange between successive windows or by running additional simulations at higher temperatures},

Unlike traditional free energy perturbation and thermodynamic integration methods, λ-dynamics treats the conventional “λ” as a dynamic variable in free energy simulations and simultaneously evaluates thermodynamic properties for multiple states in a single simulation. In the present article, we provide an overview of the theory of λ-dynamics, including the use of biasing and restraining potentials to facilitate conformational sampling. We review how λ-dynamics has been used to rapidly and reliably compute relative hydration free energies and binding affinities for series of ligands, to accurately identify crystallographically observed binding modes starting from incorrect orientations, and to model the effects of mutations upon protein stability. Finally, we suggest how λ-dynamics may be extended to facilitate modeling efforts in structure-based drug design.},

  abstract  = {The calculation of rate coefficients is a discipline of nonlinear science of importance to much of physics, chemistry, engineering, and biology. Fifty years after Kramers' seminal paper on thermally activated barrier crossing, the authors report, extend, and interpret much of our current understanding relating to theories of noise-activated escape, for which many of the notable contributions are originating from the communities both of physics and of physical chemistry. Theoretical as well as numerical approaches are discussed for single- and many-dimensional metastable systems (including fields) in gases and condensed phases. The role of many-dimensional transition-state theory is contrasted with Kramers' reaction-rate theory for moderate-to-strong friction; the authors emphasize the physical situation and the close connection between unimolecular rate theory and Kramers' work for weakly damped systems. The rate theory accounting for memory friction is presented, together with a unifying theoretical approach which covers the whole regime of weak-to-moderate-to-strong friction on the same basis (turnover theory). The peculiarities of noise-activated escape in a variety of physically different metastable potential configurations is elucidated in terms of the mean-first-passage-time technique. Moreover, the role and the complexity of escape in driven systems exhibiting possibly multiple, metastable stationary nonequilibrium states is identified. At lower temperatures, quantum tunneling effects start to dominate the rate mechanism. The early quantum approaches as well as the latest quantum versions of Kramers' theory are discussed, thereby providing a description of dissipative escape events at all temperatures. In addition, an attempt is made to discuss prominent experimental work as it relates to Kramers' reaction-rate theory and to indicate the most important areas for future research in theory and experiment.},

  abstract = {We examine the capabilities and foundations of three landmark rate theories: harmonic transition state theory, classical nucleation theory, and the Marcus theory of electron transfer. Each of the three classic rate theories is widely used to predict rates and trends. They are also used “in reverse” to interpret experimental data with no computation at all. Their common foundations include a quasi-equilibrium assumption and dimensionality reduction to a physically meaningful, one-dimensional, and broadly applicable reaction coordinate. Many applications lie beyond the scope of the classic theories, so rare events research has pursued trajectory-based methods that efficiently predict accurate rate constants even when the reaction coordinate and mechanistic details are unknown. Trajectory based rare events methods achieved these ambitious goals, but (by construction) they provide rates rather than mechanistic understanding. We briefly discuss recent efforts to identify reaction coordinates, including methods which provide abstract statistically defined coordinates and those which identify physical collective variables. Finally, we note some natural synergies between existing simulation methods which might help discover simple and powerful quasi-equilibrium theories for the many applications that fall beyond the scope of the classic rate theories.},

The action is discretized and a preconditioned BFGS method is used to optimize the discrete action. Applications are presented for thermally activated reversal in the Ginzburg-Landau model in one and two dimensions, and for noise induced excursion events in the Brusselator taken as an example of non-gradient system arising in chemistry. In the Ginzburg-Landau model, the reversal proceeds via interesting nucleation events, followed by propagation of domain walls. The issue of nucleation versus propagation is discussed and the scaling for the number of nucleation events as a function of the reversal time and other material parameters is computed. Good agreement is found with the numerical results. In the Brusselator, whose deterministic dynamics has a single stable equilibrium state, the presence of noise is shown to induce large excursions by which the system cycles out of this equilibrium state.},

We use a simulated annealing protocol to generate an ensemble of room temperature folding trajectories of fixed length, which connect predetermined initial and final states. The trajectories are distributed according to a discretized version of the Onsager–Machlup action functional. We show that, despite the enormous practical restrictions placed on the number of time slices which can be explored, some of the basic kinetic features found experimentally for the folding of peptides and small proteins are exhibited in the nature of the reaction paths sampled. We test the method on three systems: A 12 residue α-helical peptide, a 16 residue β-hairpin peptide, and the 36 residue avian Pancreatic Polypeptide (aPP). All systems are represented at atomic resolution, and include explicit water molecules. For the 12 residue α-helix, we find that (i,i+3)(i,i+3) hydrogen bonds can play a significant role in the folding pathway, with specific (i,i+3)(i,i+3) bonds appearing, then transforming to the corresponding (i,i+4)(i,i+4) hydrogen bond for some, but not all of the native hydrogen bonds. For the β-hairpin and aPP, hydrophobic interactions play a dominant role, with nonbonded interactions consistently appearing before hydrogen bonds. This is true both at the level of tertiary structure, and at the level of individual hydrogen bonds which tend to form only after stabilizing nonbonded interactions have already formed between the residues involved.},

  abstract  = {Freidlin-Wentzell theory of large deviations for the description of the effect of small random perturbations on dynamical systems is exploited as a numerical tool. Specifically, a numerical algorithm is proposed to compute the quasi-potential in the theory, which is the key object to quantify the dynamics on long time scales when the effect of the noise becomes ubiquitous: the equilibrium distribution of the system, the pathways of transition between metastable states and their rate, etc., can all be expressed in terms of the quasi-potential. We propose an algorithm to compute these quantities called the geometric minimum action method (gMAM), which is a blend of the original minimum action method (MAM) and the string method. It is based on a reformulation of the large deviations action functional on the space of curves that allows one to easily perform the double minimization of the original action required to compute the quasi-potential. The theoretical background of the gMAM in the context of large deviations theory is discussed in detail, as well as the algorithmic aspects of the method. The gMAM is then illustrated on several examples: a finite-dimensional system displaying bistability and modeled by a nongradient stochastic ordinary differential equation, an infinite-dimensional analogue of this system modeled by a stochastic partial differential equation, and an example of a bistable genetic switch modeled by a Markov jump process.},

  abstract = {Transition states are defined as points in configuration space with the highest probability that trajectories passing through them are reactive (i.e., form transition paths between reactants and products). In the high-friction (diffusive) limit of Langevin dynamics, the resulting ensemble of transition states is shown to coincide with the separatrix formed by points of equal commitment (or splitting) probabilities for reaching the product and reactant regions. Transition states according to the new criterion can be identified directly from equilibrium trajectories, or indirectly by calculating probability densities in the equilibrium and transition-path ensembles using umbrella and transition-path sampling, respectively. An algorithm is proposed to calculate rate coefficients from the transition-path and equilibrium ensembles by estimating the frequency of transitions between reactants and products.},

The rate constant, found using the potential of mean force along this coordinate, is identical to that predicted by the multidimensional Kramers–Langer theory. This reaction coordinate minimizes the one-dimensional rate constant obtained using a trial reaction coordinate and is orthogonal to the stochastic separatrix, the transition state that separates reactants from products.},

  abstract  = {The probability that a pair of ions of given initial separation will recombine with each other is computed from the laws of Brownian motion, which is the proper procedure whenever the Langevin factor equals unity, as in gases at high pressures. In the absence of forces other than the Coulomb attraction, the probability of escape equals the reciprocal of the Boltzmann factor. This result includes the correlation between temperature and pressure coefficients of the ionization by light particles previously predicted by Compton, Bennett and Stearns, if one allows their basic hypothesis about the laws which govern the initial separation of the ions. The effect of an electric field is to increase the fraction of escaping ions by a factor which in the incipient stage of the effect is proportional to the field intensity and independent of the initial distance, although it depends on the orientation of an ion pair. The predicted increase of the ionization current is a little more than one percent for every 100 volts/cm, which accounts for the observed effects of fields exceeding 1500 volts/cm. A reasonable amount of columnar recombination would help to explain the proportionately greater effects of weak fields. The inferred initial separations of the ions are apparently compatible with present knowledge of electron scattering and attachment.},

  abstract = {We review two recently developed efficient methods for calculating rate constants of processes dominated by rare events in high-dimensional complex systems. The first is transition interface sampling (TIS), based on the measurement of effective fluxes through hypersurfaces in phase space. \{TIS\} improves efficiency with respect to standard transition path sampling (TPS) rate constant techniques, because it allows a variable path length and is less sensitive to recrossings. The second method is the partial path version of TIS. Developed for diffusive processes, it exploits the loss of long time correlation. We discuss the relation between the new techniques and the standard reactive flux methods in detail. Path sampling algorithms can suffer from ergodicity problems, and we introduce several new techniques to alleviate these problems, notably path swapping, stochastic configurational bias Monte Carlo shooting moves and order-parameter free path sampling. In addition, we give algorithms to calculate other interesting properties from path ensembles besides rate constants, such as activation energies and reaction mechanisms.},

The method samples the energy landscape adaptively and determines the isoprobability surfaces for the transition:  by definition the trajectories initiated anywhere on one of these surfaces has equal probability to reach first one metastable set rather than the other. Upon weighting these surfaces by the equilibrium probability distribution, one obtains an effective transition pathway, i.e., a tube in configuration space inside which conformational changes occur with high probability, and the associated rate.

The Bayesian information criterion determines whether additional variables significantly improve the reaction coordinate. Additionally, we present an advantageous transition path sampling algorithm and an algorithm to generate the most likely transition path in the space of collective variables. The method is demonstrated on two systems: a bistable model potential energy surface and nucleation in the Ising model. For the Ising model of nucleation, we quantify for the first time the role of nuclei surface area in the nucleation reaction coordinate. Surprisingly, increased surface area increases the stability of nuclei in two dimensions but decreases nuclei stability in three dimensions.},

We introduce a simplified version of aimless shooting and a half-trajectory likelihood score based on the committor probability. Additionally, we analyze and compare the absolute log-likelihood score for perfect and approximate reaction coordinates. We also compare the aimless shooting and likelihood maximization approach to the earlier genetic neural network (GNN) approach of Ma and Dinner [J. Phys. Chem. B 109, 6769 (2005)]. For a fixed number of total trajectories in the GNN approach, the accuracy of the transition state ensemble decreases as the number of trajectories per committor probability estimate increases. This quantitatively demonstrates the benefit of individual committor probability realizations over committor probability estimates. Furthermore, when the least squares score of the GNN approach is applied to individual committor probability realizations, the likelihood score still provides a better approximation to the true transition state surface. Finally, the polymorph transition in terephthalic acid demonstrates that the new half-trajectory likelihood scheme estimates the transition state location more accurately than likelihood schemes based on the probability of being on a transition path.},

  abstract = {A new approach is developed for identifying suitable reaction coordinates to describe the progression of rare events in complex systems. The method is based on the forward flux sampling (FFS) technique and standard least-square estimation (LSE) and it is denoted as FFS-LSE. The FFS algorithm generates trajectories for the transition between stable states as chains of partially connected paths, which can then be used to obtain “on-the-fly” estimates for the committor probability to the final region, pBpB. These pBpB data are then used to screen a set of candidate collective properties for an optimal order parameter (i.e., reaction coordinate) that depends on a few relevant variables. LSE is used to find the coefficients of the proposed reaction coordinate model and an analysis of variance is used to determine the significant terms in the model. The method is demonstrated for several test systems, including the folding of a lattice protein. It is shown that a simple approximation to pBpB via a model linear on energy and number of native contacts is sufficient to describe the intrinsic dynamics of the protein system and to ensure an efficient sampling of pathways. In addition, since the pBpB surface found from the FFS-LSE approach leads to the identification of the transition state ensemble, mechanistic details of the dynamics of the system can be readily obtained during a single FFS-type simulation without the need to perform additional committor simulations.},

In the method neural networks are used to determine the functional dependence of the probability of committing to a stable state (committor) on a set of coordinates, and a genetic algorithm selects the combination of inputs that yields the best fit. The method enables us to obtain the first set of coordinates that is demonstrably sufficient to specify the transition state of the C7eq→ αR isomerization of the alanine dipeptide in the presence of explicit water molecules. It is revealed that the solute−solvent coupling can be described by a solvent-derived electrostatic torque around one of the main-chain bonds, and the collective, long-ranged nature of this interaction accounts for previous failures to characterize this reaction.},

Trajectory-based frameworks can also generate ideal (but abstract) reaction coordinates such as committors and eigenfunctions of the master equation.

A popular approach aimed at extracting dynamical information consists of projecting these trajectories into optimally selected reaction coordinates or collective variables. For equilibrium dynamics between any two boundary states, the committor function also known as the folding probability in protein folding studies is often considered as the optimal coordinate. To determine it, one selects a functional form with many parameters and trains it on the trajectories using various criteria. A major problem with such an approach is that a poor initial choice of the functional form may lead to sub-optimal results. Here, we describe an approach which allows one to optimize the reaction coordinate without selecting its functional form and thus avoiding this source of error.},

The emergent potential energy can be understood as the average energy cost for making a displacement of a coordinate in the transition path ensemble. Where displacing a bath mode invokes essentially no cost, it costs significantly to move the reaction coordinate. Based on some general assumptions of the behaviors of reaction and bath coordinates in the transition path ensemble, we proved theoretically with statistical mechanics that the emergent potential energy could serve as a benchmark of reaction coordinates and demonstrated its effectiveness by applying it to a prototypical system of biomolecular dynamics. Using the emergent potential energy as guidance, we developed a committor-free and intuition-independent method for identifying reaction coordinates in complex systems.

The pairwise energy flows between different coordinates provide a concrete statistical mechanical language for depicting reaction mechanisms. Application of this scheme to the C7eq → C7ax transition of the alanine dipeptide in vacuum revealed novel and intriguing mechanisms that eluded previous investigations of this well studied prototype system for biomolecular conformational dynamics. Using a cost function developed from the energy decomposition components by proper averaging over the transition path ensemble, we were able to identify signatures of the reaction coordinates of this system without requiring any input from human intuition.},

In order to use such a picture for a quantitative description of the dynamics one needs to select the coordinate in an optimal way so as to minimize non-Markovian effects due to the projection. For equilibrium dynamics between two boundary states (e.g., a reaction), the optimal coordinate is known as the committor or the pfold coordinate in protein folding studies. While the dynamics projected on the committor is not Markovian, many important quantities of the original multidimensional dynamics on an arbitrarily complex landscape can be computed exactly. In this study, we summarize the derivation of this result, discuss different approaches to determine and validate the committor coordinate, and present three illustrative applications: protein folding, the game of chess, and patient recovery dynamics after kidney transplant.

Such an additive function (e.g., the partition function of the reactant region) can be used as a progress coordinate to determine a one-dimensional profile (FEP) of the free-energy surface of the protein-folding reaction as well as other complex reactions. The algorithm is based on the network (obtained from an equilibrium molecular dynamics simulation) that represents the calculated reaction behavior. The resulting FEP gives the exact values of the free energy as a function of the progress coordinate; i.e., at each value of the progress coordinate, the profile is obtained from the surface with the minimal partition function among the surfaces that divide the full free-energy surface between two chosen end points. In many cases, the balanced minimum-cut procedure gives results for only a limited set of points. An approximate method based on pfold is shown to provide the profile for a more complete set of values of the progress coordinate. Applications of the approach to model problems and to realistic systems (β-hairpin of protein G, LJ38 cluster) are presented.},

  abstract  = {An approach to find transition pathways in complex systems is presented. The method, which is related to the string method in collective variables of Maragliano et al. (J. Chem. Phys. 2006, 125, 024106), is conceptually simple and straightforward to implement. It consists of refining a putative transition path in the multidimensional space supported by a set of collective variables using the average dynamic drift of those variables. This drift is estimated on-the-fly via swarms of short unbiased trajectories started at different points along the path. Successive iterations of this algorithm, which can be naturally distributed over many computer nodes with negligible interprocessor communication, refine an initial trial path toward the most probable transition path (MPTP) between two stable basins. The method is first tested by determining the pathway for the C7eq to C7ax transition in an all-atom model of the alanine dipeptide in vacuum, which has been studied previously with the string method in collective variables. A transition path is found with a committor distribution peaked at 1/2 near the free energy maximum, in accord with previous results. Last, the method is applied to the allosteric conformational change in the nitrogen regulatory protein C (NtrC), represented here with a two-state elastic network model. Even though more than 550 collective variables are used to describe the conformational change, the path converges rapidly. Again, the committor distribution is found to be peaked around 1/2 near the free energy maximum between the two stable states, confirming that a genuine transition state has been localized in this complex multidimensional system.},

A systematic, two-step procedure, based on the probabilistic framework of hidden Markov models, is developed to build a discrete-time Markov chain process that faithfully captures the internal spin label dynamics on time scales longer than about 150 ps. The constructed Markov model is used both to gain insight into the long-lived conformations of the spin label and to generate the stochastic trajectories required for the simulation of ESR spectra. The methodology is illustrated with an application to the case of a spin-labeled poly alanine α helix in explicit solvent.},

Second, the FFS algorithm is extended to obtain rate constants of partial transitions involving intermediate states from a single simulation; this is denoted “multiple state” FFS. For the FFS-US method, a FFS algorithm (preoptimized for order parameter and staging) is used to take advantage of its zero potential bias of phase-space sampling to gather histogram data with which to jump start the US and get the equilibrium distributions. In this way, kinetic data (like the rate constants and the transition path ensemble) and the underlying free-energy landscape (or probability distribution) of the system are obtained efficiently and concurrently. The applicability of these techniques is illustrated by studying several test systems, including two that involve potential energy surfaces having multiple metastable states and transition pathways, representative of complex kinetic behavior.},

As a byproduct, this “Voronoi tessellated milestoning” method also permits to compute the free energy of the tessellation.

  abstract  = {The power of transition-state theory (TST) for understanding enzymes is evidenced by its recent use in the design and synthesis of highly active de novo enzymes. However, dynamics can influence reaction kinetics, and some studies of rate-promoting vibrations even claim that dynamical theories instead of TST are needed to understand enzymatic reaction mechanisms. For the rate-promoting vibration (RPV) model of enzyme catalysis [Antoniou et al., J. Chem. Phys. 2004, 121, 6442], a reactive flux correlation function analysis shows that dynamical effects do slow the kinetics. However, the RPV model also shows extremely long-lived correlations because the RPV and the bath are not directly coupled. Additionally, earlier studies of the RPV model show a narrow time scale separation due to a small 5kT barrier. Thus earlier findings based on the RPV model may have little bearing on the properties of real enzymes. The intrinsic reaction coordinate (IRC) reveals that the RPV is an important component of the reaction coordinate at early and late stages of the pathway, but the RPV is not an important component of the reaction coordinate direction at the transition state. The unstable eigenmode from harmonic TST (which coincides with the IRC at the saddle point) gives a larger transmission coefficient than the coordinate used in the correlation functions of Antoniou et al. Thus while TST cannot predict the transmission coefficient, the RPV model suggests that TST can provide mechanistic insights on elementary steps in enzyme catalysis. Finally, we propose a method for using the transition-state ensemble as predicted from harmonic TST to distinguish promoting vibrations from other more mundane bath variables.},

  abstract = {We explore the theoretical foundation of different string methods used to find dominant reaction pathways in high-dimensional configuration spaces. Pathways are assessed by the amount of reactive flux they carry and by their orientation relative to the committor function. By examining the effects of transforming between different collective coordinates that span the same underlying space, we unmask artificial coordinate dependences in strings optimized to follow the free energy gradient. In contrast, strings optimized to follow the drift vector produce reaction pathways that are significantly less sensitive to reparameterizations of the collective coordinates. The differences in these paths arise because the drift vector depends on both the free energy gradient and the diffusion tensor of the coarse collective variables. Anisotropy and position dependence of diffusion tensors arise commonly in spaces of coarse variables, whose generally slow dynamics are obtained by nonlinear projections of the strongly coupled atomic motions. We show here that transition paths constructed to account for dynamics by following the drift vector will (to a close approximation) carry the maximum reactive flux both in systems with isotropic position dependent diffusion and in systems with constant but anisotropic diffusion. We derive a simple method for calculating the committor function along paths that follow the reactive flux. Lastly, we provide guidance for the practical implementation of the dynamic string method.},

By application of committor analysis on various constrained solvent ensembles, we find that the dissociation event is generally sensitive to solvent fluctuations at long ranges, with both sterics and electrostatics of importance. The dynamics of the reaction reveal that solvent rearrangements leading to dissociation occur on time scales from 0.5 to 5 ps or longer, and that, near the transition state, inertial effects enhance the reaction probability of a given trajectory.},

The interaction is modeled by explicitly accounting for the solvent molecules on a DFT level. The hydration energies of the metal ions along with their diffusion and mobility coefficients are determined and a trend correlated with their ionic radius is found. Subsequently, a series of 16 constrained molecular dynamics simulations for every ion is performed, and the interaction free energy is obtained from thermodynamic integration of the forces between the metal ion and the carboxylate ion. The results indicate that the magnesium ion interacts most strongly with the carboxylate, followed by calcium, strontium, and barium. Because the interaction free energy is not enough to explain the selectivity of the reaction observed experimentally, more detailed analysis is performed on the simulation trajectories to understand the steric changes in the reaction complex during dissociation. The solvent dynamics appear to play an important role during the dissociation of the complex and also in the observed selectivity behavior of the divalent ions.},

All three methods produce the same total PMF for a given ion pair. In addition, LMFT-based partitioning into van der Waals and local and far-field electrostatic free energies and assessment of the enthalpic, entropic, and ion–water components yield insights into the origins of the observed free energy profiles in water. The results highlight the importance of local electrostatic interactions in determining the shape of the PMFs, while longer-ranged interactions enhance the overall ion–ion attraction, as expected in a dielectric continuum model. The association equilibrium constants are estimated from the smooth WHAM curves and compared to available experimental conductance data.

In this study, we have presented a new procedure for studying the interactions between divalent metal ions and carboxylates by using umbrella sampling. In some cases, it is more convenient to use variable coordinate reaction probabilities instead of potential energy or free energy curves, which in general are more widely used and available in the literature. Particularly, for practical purposes in building multi-scale models it could be more convenient to use the probability of reaction as a function of the separation distance between two carboxylate moieties when they are simultaneously associated to a metal ion. In this work, we have modelled the interactions between two carboxylates (propanoate ions) and divalent metal ions (calcium or magnesium) in order to obtain the probability of reaction as a function of the separation distance between the two carboxylates. By calculating the probability, it also became apparent that in the system containing calcium, the carboxylates have higher probability of reaction compared to the system containing magnesium. Furthermore, the presented probability could be also used for other multi-scale modelling purposes where these interactions are of main importance. The proposed procedure could also have application in other systems of interest.},

  abstract = {In the present work, we use Variational Transition State Theory (VTST) to develop a practical method for transition state ensemble optimization by looking for an optimal hyperplanar dividing surface in a space of meaningful trial collective variables. These might be interatomic distances, angles, electrostatic potentials, etc. Restrained molecular dynamics simulations are used to obtain on-the-fly estimates of ensemble averages that guide the variations of the hyperplane maximizing the transmission coefficient. A central result of our work is an expression that quantitatively estimates the importance of the coordinates used for the localization of the transition state ensemble. Starting from an arbitrarily large set of trial coordinates, one can distinguish those that are indeed essential for the advance of the reaction. This facilitates the use of VTST as a practical theory to study reaction mechanisms of complex processes. The technique was applied to the reaction catalyzed by an isochorismate pyruvate lyase. This reaction involves two simultaneous chemical steps and has a shallow transition state region, making it challenging to define a good reaction coordinate. Nevertheless, the hyperplanar transition state optimized in the space of 18 geometrical coordinates provides a transmission coefficient of 0.8 and a committor histogram well-peaked about 0.5, proving the strength of the method. We have also tested the approach with the study of the NaCl dissociation in aqueous solution, a stringest test for a method based on transition state theory. We were able to find essential degrees of freedom consistent with the previous studies and to improve the transmission coefficient with respect to the value obtained using solely the NaCl distance as the reaction coordinate.

As expected, we find that water forms several ordered hydration layers, with the first hydration layer having water molecules aligned so that oxygen atoms are on average situated above Na sites. In an attempt to understand the dissolution of NaCl in water, we have then combined AIMD with constrained barrier searches, to calculate the dissolution energetics of Na+ and Cl− ions from terraces, steps, corners and kinks of the (100) surface. We find that the barrier heights show a systematic reduction from the most stable flat terrace sites, through steps to the smallest barriers for corner and kink sites. Generally, the barriers for removal of Na+ ions are slightly lower than for Cl− ions. Finally, we use our calculated barriers in a Kinetic Monte Carlo as a first order model of the dissolution process.},

  abstract  = {The calculation of ion–ion interactions in water is a problem of long standing importance. Modelling these interactions is a prerequisite to explaining Hofmeister (specific ion) effects. We here generalize our solvation model of ions to calculate the free energy of two ions in water as a function of separation. The same procedure has previously been applied to calculate ion interactions with the air–water interface successfully. The Conductor like Screening Model (COSMO) is used. This treats the ions on a quantum mechanical level and calculates numerically the electrostatic response of the surrounding solvent. Estimates of the change in the cavity formation energy and the change in the ion–water dispersion energy as the ions approach are included separately. The calculated interaction potentials are too attractive and this is a significant issue. However, they do reproduce the affinity of similarly sized ions for each other, which is a crucial property of these potentials. They are also oscillatory, another important property. We normalize the potentials to reduce the over-attraction, and good correlation with experimental values is achieved. We identify the driving contributions to this like-prefers-like behaviour. We then put forward a plausible hypothesis for the over-attraction of the potentials. An agreeable feature of our approach is that it does not rely on salt specific parameters deliberately adjusted to reproduce experimental values.},

  abstract = {Different ion pairs exhibit different dissociation kinetics; however, while the nature of this process is vital for understanding various molecular systems, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. In this study, to examine the origin of different kinetic rate constants for this process, molecular dynamics simulations were conducted for LiCl, NaCl, KCl, and CsCl in water. The results showed substantial differences in dissociation rate constant, following the trend kLiCl < kNaCl < kKCl < kCsCl. Analysis of the free-energy landscape with a solvent reaction coordinate and subsequent rate component analysis showed that the differences in these rate constants arose predominantly from the variation in solvent-state distribution between the ion pairs. The formation of a water-bridging configuration, in which the water molecule binds to an anion and a cation simultaneously, was identified as a key step in this process: water-bridge formation lowers the related dissociation free-energy barrier, thereby increasing the probability of ion-pair dissociation. Consequently, a higher probability of water-bridge formation leads to a higher ion-pair dissociation rate.

However, identifying suitable CVs is challenging, and is increasingly addressed with systematic data-driven manifold learning techniques. Here, we provide a flexible framework to model molecular systems in terms of a collection of locally valid and partially overlapping CVs: an atlas of CVs. The specific motivation for such a framework is to enhance the applicability and robustness of CVs based on manifold learning methods, which fail in the presence of periodicities in the underlying conformational manifold. More generally, using an atlas of CVs rather than a single chart may help us better describe different regions of conformational space. We develop the statistical mechanics foundation for our multi-chart description and propose an algorithmic implementation. The resulting atlas of data-based CVs are then used to enhance sampling and compute free energy surfaces in two model systems, alanine dipeptide and β-D-glucopyranose, whose conformational manifolds have toroidal and spherical topologies.},

  abstract = {Dynamics is essential to the biological functions of many bio-molecules, yet our knowledge of dynamics remains fragmented. Experimental techniques for studying bio-molecules either provide high resolution information on static conformations of the molecule or provide low-resolution, ensemble information that does not shed light on single molecule dynamics. In parallel, bio-molecular dynamics occur at time scale that are not yet attainable through detailed simulation methods. These limitations are especially noticeable when studying transition paths. To address this issue, we report in this paper two methods that derive meaningful trajectories for proteins between two of their conformations. The first method, MinActionPath, uses approximations of the potential energy surface for the molecule to derive an analytical solution of the equations of motion related to the concept of minimum action path. The second method, RelaxPath, follows the same principle of minimum action path but implements a more sophisticated potential, including a mixed elastic potential and a collision term to alleviate steric clashes. Using this new potential, the equations of motion cannot be solved analytically. We have introduced a relaxation method for solving those equations. We describe both the theories behind the two methods and their implementations, focusing on the specific techniques we have used that make those implementations amenable to study large molecular systems. We have illustrated the performance of RelaxPath on simple 2D systems. We have also compared MinActionPath and RelaxPath to other methods for generating transition paths on a well suited test set of large proteins, for which the end points of the trajectories as well as an intermediate conformation between those end points are known. We have shown that RelaxPath outperforms those other methods, including MinActionPath, in its ability to generate trajectories that get close to the known intermediates. We have also shown that the structures along the RelaxPath trajectories remain protein-like. Open source versions of the two programs MinActionPath and RelaxPath are available by request.

The choice of CVs in these simulations is essential because it affects simulation results and impacts the free-energy profile, the minimum free-energy pathway (MFEP), and the transition-state structure. Here we examine how many CVs are required to capture the correct transition-state structure during the open-to-close motion of adenylate kinase using a coarse-grained model in the mean forces string method to search the MFEP. Various numbers of large amplitude principal components are tested as CVs in the simulations. The incorporation of local coordinates into CVs, which is possible in higher dimensional CV spaces, is important for capturing a reliable MFEP. The Bayesian measure proposed by Best and Hummer is sensitive to the choice of CVs, showing sharp peaks when the transition-state structure is captured. We thus evaluate the required number of CVs needed in enhanced sampling simulations for describing protein conformational changes.},

  abstract  = {The calculations of potential of mean force along complex chemical reactions or rare events pathways are of great interest because of their importance for many areas in chemistry, molecular biology, and material science. The major difficulty for free energy calculations comes from the great computational cost for adequate sampling of the system in high-energy regions, especially close to the reaction transition state. Here, we present a method, called FEG-RBD, in which the free energy gradients were obtained from rigid body dynamics simulations. Then the free energy gradients were integrated along a reference reaction pathway to calculate free energy profiles. In a given system, the reaction coordinates defining a subset of atoms (e.g., a solute, or the quantum mechanics (QM) region of a quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics simulation) are selected to form a rigid body during the simulation. The first-order derivatives (gradients) of the free energy with respect to the reaction coordinates are obtained through the integration of constraint forces within the rigid body. Each structure along the reference reaction path is separately subjected to such a rigid body simulation. The individual free energy gradients are integrated along the reference pathway to obtain the free energy profile. Test cases provided demonstrate both the strengths and weaknesses of the FEG-RBD method. The most significant benefit of this method comes from the fast convergence rate of the free energy gradient using rigid-body constraints instead of restraints. A correction to the free energy due to approximate relaxation of the rigid-body constraint is estimated and discussed. A comparison with umbrella sampling using a simple test case revealed the improved sampling efficiency of FEG-RBD by a factor of 4 on average. The enhanced efficiency makes this method effective for calculating the free energy of complex chemical reactions when the reaction coordinate can be unambiguously defined by a small subset of atoms within the system.},

  abstract  = {The string method is a molecular-simulation technique that aims to calculate the minimum free-energy path of a chemical reaction or conformational transition, in the space of a predefined set of reaction coordinates that is typically highly dimensional. Any descriptor may be used as a reaction coordinate, but arguably the Cartesian coordinates of the atoms involved are the most unprejudiced and intuitive choice. Cartesian coordinates, however, present a nontrivial problem, in that they are not invariant to rigid-body molecular rotations and translations, which ideally ought to be unrestricted in the simulations. To overcome this difficulty, we reformulate the framework of the string method to integrate an on-the-fly structural-alignment algorithm. This approach, referred to as SOMA (String method with Optimal Molecular Alignment), enables the use of Cartesian reaction coordinates in freely tumbling molecular systems. In addition, this scheme permits the dissection of the free-energy change along the most probable path into individual atomic contributions, thus revealing the dominant mechanism of the simulated process. This detailed analysis also provides a physically meaningful criterion to coarse-grain the representation of the path. To demonstrate the accuracy of the method, we analyze the isomerization of the alanine dipeptide in a vacuum and the chair-to-inverted-chair transition of β-D mannose in explicit water. Notwithstanding the simplicity of these systems, the SOMA approach reveals novel insights into the atomic mechanism of these isomerizations. In both cases, we find that the dynamics and the energetics of the isomerization process are controlled by interactions involving only a handful of atoms in each molecule. Consistent with this result, we show that a coarse-grained SOMA calculation defined in terms of these subsets of atoms yields near-identical minimum free-energy paths and committor distributions to those obtained via a highly dimensional string.},

However, chemical reactions in solution and other real systems often have dynamical trajectories that recross the dividing surface. To separate true dynamical effects from effects of a nonoptimal dividing surface, the dividing surface and/or reaction coordinate should be optimized before computing transmission coefficients. For NaCl dissociation in TIP3P water, we show that recrossing persists even when the 1/2-committor surface itself is used as the dividing surface, providing evidence that recrossing cannot be fully eliminated from the dynamics for any configurational coordinate. Consistent with this finding, inertial likelihood maximization finds a combination of ion-pair distance and two solvent coordinates that improves the committor distribution and increases the transmission coefficient relative to those for ion-pair distance alone, but recrossing is not entirely eliminated. Free energy surfaces for the coordinates identified by inertial likelihood maximization show that the intrinsic recrossing stems from anharmonicity and shallow intermediates that remain after dimensionality reduction to the dynamically important variables.},

The method is built on sampling the dynamics within these regions: auxiliary rate constants are defined for the saddle domains and the absolute forward and backward rates are obtained by proper reweighting. We call our approach divided saddle theory (DST). An important advantage of our approach is that it requires only standard computational techniques which are available in most molecular dynamics codes.

IHS is straightforward to implement and complementary to existing methods for free energy simulation and enhanced configurational sampling. The method carries out sampling using an effective Hamiltonian constructed by integrating the Boltzmann distributions of a series of Hamiltonians. By judiciously selecting the weights of the different Hamiltonians, one achieves rapid transitions among the energy landscapes that underlie different Hamiltonians and therefore an efficient sampling of important regions of the conformational space. Along this line, IHS shares similar motivations as the enveloping distribution sampling (EDS) approach of van Gunsteren and co-workers, although the ways that distributions of different Hamiltonians are integrated are rather different in IHS and EDS. Specifically, we report efficient ways for determining the weights using a combination of histogram flattening and weighted histogram analysis approaches, which make it straightforward to include many end-state and intermediate Hamiltonians in IHS so as to enhance its flexibility. Using several relatively simple condensed phase examples, we illustrate the implementation and application of IHS as well as potential developments for the near future. The relation of IHS to several related sampling methods such as Hamiltonian replica exchange molecular dynamics and λ-dynamics is also briefly discussed.},

  abstract  = {In the host of numerical schemes devised to calculate free energy differences by way of geometric transformations, the adaptive biasing force algorithm has emerged as a promising route to map complex free-energy landscapes. It relies upon the simple concept that as a simulation progresses, a continuously updated biasing force is added to the equations of motion, such that in the long-time limit it yields a Hamiltonian devoid of an average force acting along the transition coordinate of interest. This means that sampling proceeds uniformly on a flat free-energy surface, thus providing reliable free-energy estimates. Much of the appeal of the algorithm to the practitioner is in its physically intuitive underlying ideas and the absence of any requirements for prior knowledge about free-energy landscapes. Since its inception in 2001, the adaptive biasing force scheme has been the subject of considerable attention, from in-depth mathematical analysis of convergence properties to novel developments and extensions. The method has also been successfully applied to many challenging problems in chemistry and biology. In this contribution, the method is presented in a comprehensive, self-contained fashion, discussing with a critical eye its properties, applicability, and inherent limitations, as well as introducing novel extensions. Through free-energy calculations of prototypical molecular systems, many methodological aspects are examined, from stratification strategies to overcoming the so-called hidden barriers in orthogonal space, relevant not only to the adaptive biasing force algorithm but also to other importance-sampling schemes. On the basis of the discussions in this paper, a number of good practices for improving the efficiency and reliability of the computed free-energy differences are proposed.},

  abstract  = {A method is developed to obtain simultaneously free energy profiles and diffusion constants from restrained molecular simulations in diffusive systems. The method is based on low-order expansions of the free energy and diffusivity as functions of the reaction coordinate. These expansions lead to simple analytical relationships between simulation statistics and model parameters. The method is tested on 1D and 2D model systems; its accuracy is found to be comparable to or better than that of the existing alternatives, which are briefly discussed. An important aspect of the method is that the free energy is constructed by integrating its derivatives, which can be computed without need for overlapping sampling windows. The implementation of the method in any molecular simulation program that supports external umbrella potentials (e.g., CHARMM) requires modification of only a few lines of code. As a demonstration of its applicability to realistic biomolecular systems, the method is applied to model the α-helix ↔ β-sheet transition in a 16-residue peptide in implicit solvent, with the reaction coordinate provided by the string method. Possible modifications of the method are briefly discussed; they include generalization to multidimensional reaction coordinates [in the spirit of the model of Ermak and McCammon (Ermak, D. L.; McCammon, J. A. J. Chem. Phys. 1978, 69, 1352–1360)], a higher-order expansion of the free energy surface, applicability in nonequilibrium systems, and a simple test for Markovianity. In view of the small overhead of the method relative to standard umbrella sampling, we suggest its routine application in the cases where umbrella potential simulations are appropriate.},

The approach allows testing hypotheses on the reaction mechanism but could, in principle, also be used to construct the phase-space committor surfaces without the need of additional trajectory sampling. The procedure is illustrated for a one-dimensional double-well potential, a theoretical model for an ion-transfer reaction in which the solvent structure can lower the barrier, and an ab initio molecular dynamics study of water auto-ionization. The analysis technique enhances the quantitative interpretation of path sampling data which can provide clues on how chemical reactions can be steered in desired directions.},

  abstract  = {The growing string method (GSM) is highly useful for locating reaction paths connecting two molecular intermediates. GSM has often been used in a two-step procedure to locate exact transition states (TS), where GSM creates a quality initial structure for a local TS search. This procedure and others like it, however, do not always converge to the desired transition state because the local search is sensitive to the quality of the initial guess. This article describes an integrated technique for simultaneous reaction path and exact transition state search. This is achieved by implementing an eigenvector following optimization algorithm in internal coordinates with Hessian update techniques. After partial convergence of the string, an exact saddle point search begins under the constraint that the maximized eigenmode of the TS node Hessian has significant overlap with the string tangent near the TS. Subsequent optimization maintains connectivity of the string to the TS as well as locks in the TS direction, all but eliminating the possibility that the local search leads to the wrong TS. To verify the robustness of this approach, reaction paths and TSs are found for a benchmark set of more than 100 elementary reactions.},

In this study, we perform an exhaustive sampling composed of 6 μs well-tempered metadynamics and 2 μs unbiased molecular dynamics (MD) simulations aiming at characterizing the binding mechanisms and structural properties of these two peptides. Our results agree with previous experimental observations that PTMA is remarkably more disordered than NRF2 in both the free and bound states. This explains PTMA’s lower binding affinity. Our extensive sampling also provides valuable insights into the vast conformational ensembles of both NRF2 and PTMA, supports the hypothesis of coupled folding–binding, and confirms the essential role of linear motifs in IDP binding.},

  abstract  = {Metadynamics is an important enhanced sampling technique in molecular dynamics simulation to efficiently explore potential energy surfaces. The recently developed transition-tempered metadynamics (TTMetaD) has been proven to converge asymptotically without sacrificing exploration of the collective variable space in the early stages of simulations, unlike other convergent metadynamics (MetaD) methods. We have applied TTMetaD to study the permeation of drug-like molecules through a lipid bilayer to further investigate the usefulness of this method as applied to problems of relevance to medicinal chemistry. First, ethanol permeation through a lipid bilayer was studied to compare TTMetaD with nontempered metadynamics and well-tempered metadynamics. The bias energies computed from various metadynamics simulations were compared to the potential of mean force calculated from umbrella sampling. Though all of the MetaD simulations agree with one another asymptotically, TTMetaD is able to predict the most accurate and reliable estimate of the potential of mean force for permeation in the early stages of the simulations and is robust to the choice of required additional parameters. We also show that using multiple randomly initialized replicas allows convergence analysis and also provides an efficient means to converge the simulations in shorter wall times and, more unexpectedly, in shorter CPU times; splitting the CPU time between multiple replicas appears to lead to less overall error. After validating the method, we studied the permeation of a more complicated drug-like molecule, trimethoprim. Three sets of TTMetaD simulations with different choices of collective variables were carried out, and all converged within feasible simulation time. The minimum free energy paths showed that TTMetaD was able to predict almost identical permeation mechanisms in each case despite significantly different definitions of collective variables.},

We report simulations of several folding trajectories of NTL9(1−39), a protein which has a folding time of ∼1.5 ms. Distributed molecular dynamics simulations in implicit solvent on GPU processors were used to generate ensembles of trajectories out to ∼40 μs for several temperatures and starting states. At a temperature less than the melting point of the force field, we observe a small number of productive folding events, consistent with predictions from a model of parallel uncoupled two-state simulations. The posterior distribution of the folding rate predicted from the data agrees well with the experimental folding rate (∼640/s). Markov State Models (MSMs) built from the data show a gap in the implied time scales indicative of two-state folding and heterogeneous pathways connecting diffuse mesoscopic substates. Structural analysis of the 14 out of 2000 macrostates transited by the top 10 folding pathways reveals that native-like pairing between strands 1 and 2 only occurs for macrostates with pfold > 0.5, suggesting β12 hairpin formation may be rate-limiting. We believe that using simulation data such as these to seed adaptive resampling simulations will be a promising new method for achieving statistically converged descriptions of folding landscapes at longer time scales than ever before.},

  abstract  = {Identification of the collective coordinates that describe rare events in complex molecular transitions such as protein folding has been a key challenge in the theoretical molecular sciences. In the Diffusion Map approach, one assumes that the molecular configurations sampled have been generated by a diffusion process, and one uses the eigenfunctions of the corresponding diffusion operator as reaction coordinates. While diffusion coordinates (DCs) appear to provide a good approximation to the true dynamical reaction coordinates, they are not parametrized using dynamical information. Thus, their approximation quality could not, as yet, be validated, nor could the diffusion map eigenvalues be used to compute relaxation rate constants of the system. Here we combine the Diffusion Map approach with the recently proposed Variational Approach for Conformation Dynamics (VAC). Diffusion Map coordinates are used as a basis set, and their optimal linear combination is sought using the VAC, which employs time-correlation information on the molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories. We have applied this approach to ultra-long MD simulations of the Fip35 WW domain and found that the first DCs are indeed a good approximation to the true reaction coordinates of the system, but they could be further improved using the VAC. Using the Diffusion Map basis, excellent approximations to the relaxation rates of the system are obtained. Finally, we evaluate the quality of different metric spaces and find that pairwise minimal root-mean-square deviation performs poorly, while operating in the recently introduced kinetic maps based on the time-lagged independent component analysis gives the best performance.},

The observation leads to a number of interesting results. In particular, the equilibrium flux between two boundary states can be computed exactly as diffusion on a free energy profile associated with the coordinate. The mean square displacement, for the trajectory projected onto the coordinate, grows linear with time. That for the same trajectory projected onto a suboptimal coordinate grows slower than linear with time. The results are illustrated on a number of model systems, Sierpinski gasket, FIP35 protein, and beta3s peptide.},

These diverse, complex and often high-dimensional data sets exhibit nonlinear dependencies and unknown interactions across multiple variables, and may fail to conform to the assumptions of many classical statistical methods. The field of machine learning provides methodologies that are ideally suited to the task of extracting knowledge from these data. In this review, we aim to introduce animal behaviourists unfamiliar with machine learning (ML) to the promise of these techniques for the analysis of complex behavioural data. We start by describing the rationale behind ML and review a number of animal behaviour studies where ML has been successfully deployed. The ML framework is then introduced by presenting several unsupervised and supervised learning methods. Following this overview, we illustrate key ML approaches by developing data analytical pipelines for three different case studies that exemplify the types of behavioural and ecological questions ML can address. The first uses a large number of spectral and morphological characteristics that describe the appearance of pheasant, Phasianus colchicus, eggs to assign them to putative clutches. The second takes a continuous data stream of feeder visits from PIT (passive integrated transponder)-tagged jackdaws, Corvus monedula, and extracts foraging events from it, which permits the construction of social networks. Our final example uses aerial images to train a classifier that detects the presence of wildebeest, Connochaetes taurinus, to count individuals in a population. With the advent of cheaper sensing and tracking technologies an unprecedented amount of data on animal behaviour is becoming available. We believe that ML will play a central role in translating these data into scientific knowledge and become a useful addition to the animal behaviourist's analytical toolkit.},

To enable faster development of machine-learning-based models for such applications, we have created a framework capable of being applied to a broad range of materials data. Our method works by using a chemically diverse list of attributes, which we demonstrate are suitable for describing a wide variety of properties, and a novel method for partitioning the data set into groups of similar materials to boost the predictive accuracy. In this manuscript, we demonstrate how this new method can be used to predict diverse properties of crystalline and amorphous materials, such as band gap energy and glass-forming ability.},

To tackle a new application, a researcher typically tries to map their problem onto one of these existing methods, often influenced by their familiarity with specific algorithms and by the availability of corresponding software implementations. In this study, we describe an alternative methodology for applying machine learning, in which a bespoke solution is formulated for each new application. The solution is expressed through a compact modelling language, and the corresponding custom machine learning code is then generated automatically. This model-based approach offers several major advantages, including the opportunity to create highly tailored models for specific scenarios, as well as rapid prototyping and comparison of a range of alternative models. Furthermore, newcomers to the field of machine learning do not have to learn about the huge range of traditional methods, but instead can focus their attention on understanding a single modelling environment. In this study, we show how probabilistic graphical models, coupled with efficient inference algorithms, provide a very flexible foundation for model-based machine learning, and we outline a large-scale commercial application of this framework involving tens of millions of users. We also describe the concept of probabilistic programming as a powerful software environment for model-based machine learning, and we discuss a specific probabilistic programming language called Infer.NET, which has been widely used in practical applications.},

In this paper we use the first few eigenfunctions of the backward Fokker–Planck diffusion operator as a coarse-grained low dimensional representation for the long-term evolution of a stochastic system and show that they are optimal under a certain mean squared error criterion. We denote the mapping from physical space to these eigenfunctions as the diffusion map. While in high dimensional systems these eigenfunctions are difficult to compute numerically by conventional methods such as finite differences or finite elements, we describe a simple computational data-driven method to approximate them from a large set of simulated data. Our method is based on defining an appropriately weighted graph on the set of simulated data and computing the first few eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the corresponding random walk matrix on this graph. Thus, our algorithm incorporates the local geometry and density at each point into a global picture that merges data from different simulation runs in a natural way. Furthermore, we describe lifting and restriction operators between the diffusion map space and the original space. These operators facilitate the description of the coarse-grained dynamics, possibly in the form of a low dimensional effective free energy surface parameterized by the diffusion map reduction coordinates. They also enable a systematic exploration of such effective free energy surfaces through the design of additional “intelligently biased” computational experiments. We conclude by demonstrating our method in a few examples.},

It is shown that the matrices needed for the linear variation method are correlation matrices that can be estimated from simple MD simulations for a given basis set. The method proposed here is thus to first define a basis set able to capture the relevant conformational transitions, then compute the respective correlation matrices, and then to compute their dominant eigenvalues and eigenvectors, thus obtaining the key ingredients of the slow kinetics.},

However, problems caused by the fact that the molecular dynamics system contains only one ion make it more profitable to discuss the dynamics in terms of the motion of the water molecules in the first coordination shell of the ion. A definition of residence time in the coordination shell is proposed and leads to values for the hydration numbers which are consistent with estimates derived from electrochemical measurements. The ionic mobilities are analyzed in terms of a theoretical model involving a nonuniform viscosity. The latter may be characterized either by the reorientation times of water molecules in the first coordination sphere or by their residence times. In either case, good agreement is obtained with the experimentally determined Walden products.},

To improve the POL1 model, we developed a new set of atomic polarizabilities that reproduce the experimental molecular polarizability for water using the atom–dipole interaction model (Applequist, Carl, and Fung [J. Am. Soc. Chem. 94, 2952 (1972)]). Using the new atomic polarizabilities, we optimized the Lennard‐Jones parameters for O–O interactions to improve the model. As expected, the new model has improved the radial distribution functions and the average potential energy for liquid water as well as the density and the average total dipole moment. The model is then used to compute the binding energies of Cs+–water clusters. Without the need for three‐body forces (ion–water–water interaction), the agreement between the results of molecular‐dynamics simulations and experimental energies of cluster formation is very good.},

Molecular expressions are derived for a macroscopic phenomenological rate constant. The form of several of these equations depend upon what ensemble is used when performing averages over initial conditions. All of these formulas, however, reduce to one final physical expression whose value is manifestly independent of ensemble. The validity of the physical expression hinges on a separation of time scales and the plateau value problem. The approximations needed to obtain transition state theory are described and the errors involved are estimated. The coupling of the reaction coordinate to the liquid medium provides the dissipation necessary for the existence of a plateau value for the rate constant, but it also leads to failures of Wigner’s fundamental assumption for transition state theory. We predict that for many isomerization reactions, the transmission coefficient will differ significantly from unity and that the difference will be a strong function of the thermodynamic state of the liquid solvent.},

Our computed barrier heights for water exchange are significantly larger than those obtained using classical non-polarizable force fields.

We suggest an alternate, robust determination based on the stable states picture (SSP) of chemical reactions (J. Chem. Phys. 1980, 73, 2700−2714) where recrossing is naturally discarded. This is illustrated by calculation of the water residence time next to a water molecule and next to a chloride ion, using both nonpolarizable and polarizable force-fields. The SSP results are in good agreement with the residence times estimated by a separate kinetic analysis, and differ noticeably from those calculated in the conventional fashion mentioned above.},

The ion mobilities show the same trends as the experimental results with distinct maxima for cations and anions. The mobilities (defined by ui = Di/kT) of the corresponding uncharged species are also determined by simulation and are in qualitative agreement with Stokes' law. The mobilities of Li+, Na+, K+, Rb+ and F- increase on discharge, whereas Cl, Br, and I have smaller mobilities than the corresponding anions. The mobility of the fictitious I+ ion, which differs from I- only in its charge, lies between that of I- and I in the order uI < uI+ < uI−. The residence time of water in the first solvation shell of small cations (Li+ and Na+) and Ca2+ decreases when the ions are discharged, while the opposite is observed on neutralizing I-, suggesting the formation of a solvent cage around the large uncharged I which partially breaks up on charging, increasing the mobility of the corresponding ion. The cage breakup is greater for I- than for I+ which correlates with the asymmetry in the entropies of solvation of I- and I+, in SPC/E water on charge reversal, providing an explanation for the trends in the mobilities of I, I-, and I+. The residence times of water in the primary hydration shell around cations pass through a minimum as a function of size that correlates with the maximum in the corresponding solvation entropy, suggesting different types of hydration, i.e., electrostatic ion solvation (hydrophilic) and cage formation (hydrophobic) respectively for small and large cations. The results are in accord with recent calculations of the solvation entropy and free energy as continuous functions of the charge and size (Lynden-Bell, R. M.; Rasaiah, J. C. J. Chem. Phys. 1997, 107, 1981). Hydrophilic and hydrophobic solvation are reflected in the exchange dynamics of the water in the hydration shells around charged and uncharged solutes. The solvation dynamics of individual cations and anions are distinct at short times but characterized by the solvent at long times. Solvent dynamics, structure, and caging modulated by the charge and size of the ions are strongly implicated in determining their mobilities.},

  abstract = {The rates and mechanisms of water exchange around two aqueous ions, namely, Na+Na+ and Fe2+Fe2+, have been determined using transition path sampling. In particular, the pressure dependence of the water exchange rates was computed to determine activation volumes. A common approach for calculating water exchange rates, the reactive flux method, was also employed and the two methods were compared. The water exchange rate around Na+Na+ is fast enough to be calculated by direct molecular dynamics simulations, thus providing a reference for comparison. Both approaches predicted exchange rates and activation volumes in agreement with the direct simulation results. Four additional sodium potential models were considered to compare the results of this work with the only activation volume for Na+Na+ previously determined from molecular simulation [D. Spångberg et al., Chem. Phys. Lett. 276, 114 (1997)] and provide the best possible estimate of the activation volume based on the ability of the models to reproduce known properties of the aqueous sodium ion. The Spångberg and Hermansson [D. Spångberg and K. Hermansson, J. Chem. Phys. 120, 4829 (2004)] and X-Plor/Charmm-22 [M. Patra and M. Karttunen, J. Comput. Chem. 25, 678 (2004)] models performed best and predicted activation volumes of −0.22 and −0.78 cm3 mol−1−0.78 cm3 mol−1, respectively. For water exchange around Fe2+Fe2+, transition path sampling predicts an activation volume of +3.8 cm3 mol−1+3.8 cm3 mol−1, in excellent agreement with the available experimental data. The potential of mean force calculation in the reactive flux approach, however, failed to sufficiently sample appropriate transition pathways and the opposite pressure dependence of the rate was predicted as a result. Analysis of the reactive trajectories obtained with the transition path sampling approach suggests that the Fe2+Fe2+ exchange reaction takes place via an associative interchange mechanism, which goes against the conventional mechanistic interpretation of a positive activation volume. Collectively, considerable insight was obtained not only for the exchange rates and mechanisms for Na+Na+ and Fe2+Fe2+ but also for identifying the most robust modeling strategy for these purposes.},

Excellent agreement is obtained with the existing experimental data for the structure of the first hydration shell around the Li+Li+ ion. Spectral features of bound water are compared to those of bulk water. Reasonable agreement is obtained with IR and Raman experiments. The ab initio simulation results have also been used to derive a Li+Li+–water interaction potential. The best fit of the data gave a simple single-exponential potential function, which reproduces very well the liquid structure from the original ab initio simulations. This potential model, together with the simple point charge (SPC) water model, was applied to calculate the hydration free energy of Li+Li+ using the Expanded Ensemble method.},

Radial distribution functions, coordination number distributions, and various angular distributions have been used to discuss details of the hydration structure, together with bond lengths and bond angles of the water molecules in the first hydration shell. The lithium ion is found to be mainly fourfold coordinated with some smaller amounts of fivefold coordination. The lithium–water cluster exhibits a nearly perfect tetrahedral but still very flexible structure, in which coordinated water molecules are considerably tilted away from planarity.

The resulting properties are analyzed with respect to both basis set completeness and degree of correlation recovery, including core–core and core–valence effects. Although the lithium–water interaction is largely electrostatic in nature, small basis sets, lacking in polarization and near‐valence diffuse functions, drastically overestimate the strength of the bond (by 20 kcal/mol or more) and underestimate the Li+...O distance by up to 0.1 Å. Their poor performance is attributable to inherent errors in describing the electric moments and polarizability of water and to large basis set superposition errors. Thus, the accuracy with which the fundamental lithium–water interaction could be modeled was primarily dependent on the quality of the Gaussian basis set and not upon the level of correlation recovery. Basis set enlargement and correlation effects both tend to reduce the strength of the Li+(H2O) bond, but produce corrections of opposite sign for the Li+...O bond length. Although correlation effects play a minor role in describing the lithium–water interaction, as the size of the cluster increases and the number of waters involved in multiple hydrogen bonds grows, correlation recovery can become significant.},

Our simulations successfully captured the different hydration behavior shown by the three alkali ions as observed in experiments. The present analyses of the dependence of the self-diffusion coefficient and rotational correlation time of water on the ion concentration suggest that Li+Li+ (K+)(K+) is certainly categorized as a structure maker (breaker), whereas Na+Na+ acts as a weak structure breaker. An analysis of the relevant electronic structures, based on maximally localized Wannier functions, revealed that the dipole moment of H2OH2O molecules in the first solvation shell of Na+Na+ and K+K+ decreases by about 0.1 D compared to that in the bulk, due to a contraction of the oxygen lone pair orbital pointing toward the metal ion.

By introducing new and more-accurate data reduction procedures than in our earlier studies (I. Howell and G. W. Neilson, J. Phys: Condens. Matter, 1996, 8, 4455–4463), we find, in the first hydration shell of Li+, ∼4.3(2) water molecules at 6 m, 4.9(3) at 3 m, 4.8(3) at 1 m in the LiCl solutions, and 5.0(3) water molecules in the case of Li2SO4 solution. The general form of the first hydration shell is similar in all four solutions, with the correlations for Li–O and Li–D sited at 1.96 (0.02) Å and 2.58 (0.02) Å, respectively. The results resemble those presented in 1996, in terms of ion–water distances and local coordination, but the hydration number is significantly lower for the case at 1 m than the 6.5 (1.0) given at that time. Thus, experimental and theoretical results now agree that lithium is hydrated by a small number of water molecules (4–5) in the nearest coordination shell.},

A range of commonly used functionals predict water exchange rates several orders of magnitude lower than the experimental ones. This effect is attributed to the overstabilization of coordination number four by these functionals with respect to the five-coordinated transition states responsible for the associative (A) or associative interchange (Ia) water exchange mechanisms. However, the M06 and M062X functionals provide results in good agreement with the experimental data: M062X/TZVP calculations yield a concerted Ia mechanism for the water exchange in [Be(H2O)4]2+·8H2O that gives an average residence time of water molecules in the first coordination sphere of 260 μs.

The theory treats composition fluctuations that would be accessed by larger-scale calculations, and also longer-ranged interactions that are of special interest for electrolyte solutions. The quasi-chemical organization breaks-up governing free energies into physically distinct contributions: packing, outer-shell, and chemical contributions. Here we study specifically the outer-shell contributions that express electrolyte screening. For that purpose we adopt a primitive model suggested by observation of ion-pairing in tetraethylammonium tetrafluoroborate dissolved in propylene carbonate. Gaussian statistical models are shown to be effective physical models for outer-shell contributions, and they are conclusive for the free energies within the quasi-chemical formulation. With the present data set the Gaussian physical approximation obtains more accurate mean activity coefficients than does the Bennett direct evaluation of that free energy.},

Our simulations show that the structures of the most stable monomers of magnesium bi-carbonate and magnesium carbonate in solution are Mg[η1-HCO3](H2O)4+ and Mg[η1-CO3](H2O)4, i.e. the preferred hydration number is four, while the (bi-)carbonate is coordinated to the magnesium in a monodentate mode. The analysis of the exchange processes of the water molecules in the first and second hydration shell of Mg2+ shows that the HCO3− or CO32− ligands affect the dynamics of the magnesium coordination spheres by making its hydration shell more “labile”. Furthermore, molecular dynamics simulations of the non-associated Mg2+/Cl− pair in water suggest that, despite negligible differences in the coordination spheres of Mg2+, the chloride anion has a significant influence on the water exchange rates in the second hydration shell of Mg2+.},

The significant increase in computational resources as well as the development of new and efficient algorithms has elevated this method to the status of a standard quantum mechanical tool that is used by both experimentalists and theoreticians. As AIMD computes the electronic structure from first principles, it is free of ad hoc parametrizations and has thus been applied to a large variety of physical and chemical problems. In particular, AIMD has provided microscopic insight into the structural and dynamical properties of aqueous solutions which are often challenging to probe experimentally. In this review, after a brief theoretical description of the Born–Oppenheimer and Car–Parrinello molecular dynamics formalisms, we show how AIMD has enhanced our understanding of the properties of liquid water and its constituent ions: the proton and the hydroxide ion. Thereafter, a broad overview of the application of AIMD to other aqueous systems, such as solvated organic molecules and inorganic ions, is presented. We also briefly describe the latest theoretical developments made in AIMD, such as methods for enhanced sampling and the inclusion of nuclear quantum effects.},

Currently accepted models of ions, especially for divalent ions, do not necessarily reproduce the right physiological behavior of Ca2+ and Mg2+ ions. Saxena and Sept (J. Chem. Theor. Comput. 2013, 9, 3538–3542) described a model, called the multisite-ion model, where instead of treating the ions as an isolated sphere, the charge was split into multiple sites with partial charge. This model provided accurate inner shell coordination of the ion with biomolecules and predicted better free energies for proteins and nucleic acids. Here, we expand and refine the multisite model to describe the behavior of divalent ions in concentrated MgCl2 and CaCl2 electrolyte solutions, eliminating the unusual ion–ion pairing and clustering of ions which occurred in the original model. We calibrate and improve the parameters of the multisite model by matching the osmotic pressure of concentrated solutions of MgCl2 to the experimental values and then use these parameters to test the behavior of CaCl2 solutions. We find that the concentrated solutions of both divalent ions exhibit the experimentally observed behavior with correct osmotic pressure, the presence of solvent separated ion pairs instead of direct ion pairs, and no aggregation of ions. The improved multisite model for (Mg2+ and Ca2+) can be used in classical simulations of biomolecules at physiologically relevant salt concentrations.},

Is the action of cations and anions on water cooperative or not? Here, we investigate how the reorientation and hydrogen-bond dynamics of water are affected by ions in dilute and concentrated aqueous salt solutions. By combining simulations and analytic modeling, we first show that ions have a short-ranged influence on the reorientation of individual water molecules and that depending on their interaction strength with water, they may accelerate or slow down water dynamics. A simple additive picture combining the effects of the cations and anions is found to provide a good description in dilute solutions. In concentrated solutions, we show that the average water reorientation time ceases to scale linearly with salt concentration due to overlapping hydration shells and structural rearrangements which reduce the translational displacements induced by hydrogen-bond switches and increase the solution viscosity. This effect is not ion-specific and explains why all concentrated salt solutions slow down water dynamics. Our picture, which is demonstrated to be robust vis-a-vis a change in the force-field, reconciles the seemingly contradictory experimental results obtained by ultrafast infrared and NMR spectroscopies, and suggests that there are no long-ranged cooperative ion effects on the dynamics of individual water molecules in dilute solutions.},

The sensitivity of the CN stretching frequency of thiocyanate (SCN−) to contact ion pair formation with Mg2+ ions generates distinct spectroscopic signatures for the MgNCS+ contact ion pair and the free SCN−. We have utilized 2DIR spectroscopy to successfully resolve the interconversion between these thiocyanate configurations and measured the MgNCS+ contact ion pair dissociation time constant to be 52 ± 10 ps. We attribute the observed dynamics to perchlorate−thiocyanate anion exchange in the first solvation shell of the Mg2+ cation. Magnesium ions in this concentrated ionic solution will be coordinated by water molecules, as well as perchlorate and thiocyanate ions. While prior studies have observed microsecond residence times for water ligands in the first coordination sphere of Mg2+, our study represents the first experimental observation of anion exchange in the first solvent shell of the Mg2+ cation. We have also used orientational relaxation and spectral diffusion dynamics to quantify the dynamical distinctions between the free anion and the anion in the contact ion pair.},

Here, we combine statistical mechanical theory, ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, and electronic structure methods to calculate the hydration free energy and local hydration structure of Ba2+(aq). The predicted hydration free energy (−304 ± 1 kcal/mol) agrees with the experimental value (−303 kcal/mol) when a maximally occupied, unimodal inner solvation shell is treated. In the local environment defined by the first shell of hydrating waters, Ba2+ is directly and stably coordinated by eight (8) waters.

  abstract  = {Gaussian accelerated molecular dynamics (GaMD) is a recently developed enhanced sampling technique that provides efficient free energy calculations of biomolecules. Like the previous accelerated molecular dynamics (aMD), GaMD allows for “unconstrained” enhanced sampling without the need to set predefined collective variables and so is useful for studying complex biomolecular conformational changes such as protein folding and ligand binding. Furthermore, because the boost potential is constructed using a harmonic function that follows Gaussian distribution in GaMD, cumulant expansion to the second order can be applied to recover the original free energy profiles of proteins and other large biomolecules, which solves a long-standing energetic reweighting problem of the previous aMD method. Taken together, GaMD offers major advantages for both unconstrained enhanced sampling and free energy calculations of large biomolecules. Here, we have implemented GaMD in the NAMD package on top of the existing aMD feature and validated it on three model systems: alanine dipeptide, the chignolin fast-folding protein, and the M3 muscarinic G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR). For alanine dipeptide, while conventional molecular dynamics (cMD) simulations performed for 30 ns are poorly converged, GaMD simulations of the same length yield free energy profiles that agree quantitatively with those of 1000 ns cMD simulation. Further GaMD simulations have captured folding of the chignolin and binding of the acetylcholine (ACh) endogenous agonist to the M3 muscarinic receptor. The reweighted free energy profiles are used to characterize the protein folding and ligand binding pathways quantitatively. GaMD implemented in the scalable NAMD is widely applicable to enhanced sampling and free energy calculations of large biomolecules.},

In each replica two copies of the same system with halved potential strengths interact via inelastic springs. The strength of the spring is varied in the different replicas so as to bridge the gap between the infinitely strong spring, that corresponds to the Boltzmann replica, and the less tight ones. We enhance the spring length fluctuations using Metadynamics. We test the method on simple yet challenging problems.},

  title     = {The Extended Generalized Adaptive Biasing Force Algorithm for Multidimensional Free-Energy Calculations},
  journal   = {J. Chem. Theory Comput.},
  year      = {2017},
  abstract  = {Free-energy calculations in multiple dimensions constitute a challenging problem, owing to the significant computational cost incurred to achieve ergodic sampling. The generalized adaptive biasing force (gABF) algorithm calculates n one-dimensional lists of biasing forces to approximate the n-dimensional matrix by ignoring the coupling terms ordinarily taken into account in classical ABF simulations, thereby greatly accelerating sampling in the multidimensional space. This approximation may however occasionally lead to poor, incomplete exploration of the conformational space compared to classical ABF, especially when the selected coarse variables are strongly coupled. It has been found that introducing extended potentials coupled to the coarse variables of interest can virtually eliminate this shortcoming, and, thus, improve the efficiency of gABF simulations. In the present contribution, we propose a new free-energy method, coined extended generalized ABF (egABF), combining gABF with an extended Lagrangian strategy. The results for three illustrative examples indicate that (i) egABF can explore the transition coordinate much more efficiently compared with classical ABF, eABF, and gABF, in both simple and complex cases and (ii) egABF can achieve a higher accuracy than gABF, with a root mean-squared deviation between egABF and eABF free-energy profiles on the order of kBT. Furthermore, the new egABF algorithm outruns the previous ABF-based algorithms in high-dimensional free-energy calculations and, hence, represents a powerful importance-sampling alternative for the investigation of complex chemical and biological processes.},

  abstract  = {Identification of the main reaction coordinates and building of kinetic models of macromolecular systems require a way to measure distances between molecular configurations that can distinguish slowly interconverting states. Here we define the commute distance that can be shown to be closely related to the expected commute time needed to go from one configuration to the other, and back. A practical merit of this quantity is that it can be easily approximated from molecular dynamics data sets when an approximation of the Markov operator eigenfunctions is available, which can be achieved by the variational approach to approximate eigenfunctions of Markov operators, also called variational approach of conformation dynamics (VAC) or the time-lagged independent component analysis (TICA). The VAC or TICA components can be scaled such that a so-called commute map is obtained in which Euclidean distance corresponds to the commute distance, and thus kinetic models such as Markov state models can be computed based on Euclidean operations, such as standard clustering. In addition, the distance metric gives rise to a quantity we call total kinetic content, which is an excellent score to rank input feature sets and kinetic model quality.},

Formamide has been selected as a case study in view of its interest as a precursor in the abiotic amino acid synthesis. After validation of the level of theory chosen for describing the potential energy surface, we have investigated several pathways of the OH + CH2NH and NH2 + H2CO reaction channels. Our results show that both reaction channels are essentially barrierless (in the sense that all relevant transition states lie below or only marginally above the reactants) and once tunneling is taken into the proper account indicate that the reaction can occur under the low temperature conditions of interstellar environments.},

We will show that this protocol can be several orders of magnitude more efficient than the traditional protocol for large multidimensional problems.

Various approaches are available for such studies. However, their strengths and weaknesses may not be immediately apparent. Using the retaining glycosyltransferase ppGalNAcT2 as a case study, we compare different methodologies used to obtain reaction paths and transition state information. Ab Initio MD using CPMD coupled with the String Method is used to derive the minimum free energy reaction path. The geometrical features of the free energy path, especially around the transition state, agree with the minimum potential energy path obtained by the much less computationally expensive Nudged Elastic Band method. The barrier energy, however, differs by 8 kcal/mol. The free energy surface generated by metadynamics provides a rough overview of the reaction and can confirm the physical relevance of optimized paths or provide an initial guess for path optimization methods. Calculations of enzymatic reactions are usually performed at best at the DFT level of theory. A comparison of widely used functionals with high-level DLPNO-CCSD(T)/CBS data on the potential energy profile serves as a validation of the usability of DFT for this type of enzymatic reaction. The M06-2X meta-hybrid functional in particular matches the DLPNO-CCSD(T)/CBS reference extremely well with errors within 1 kcal/mol. However, even pure-GGA functional OPBE provides sufficient accuracy for this type of study.},

We use genetic algorithms for the optimization of training set composition consisting of tens of thousands of small organic molecules. The resulting machine learning models are considerably more accurate: in the limit of small training sets, mean absolute errors for out-of-sample predictions are reduced by up to ∼75%. We discuss and present optimized training sets consisting of 10 molecular classes for all molecular properties studied. We show that these classes can be used to design improved training sets for the generation of machine learning models of the same properties in similar but unrelated molecular sets.},

We performed extensive first-principles simulations of solutions of a simple salt (NaCl) and found that, while the cation does not significantly change the structure of water beyond the first solvation shell, the anion has a further reaching effect, modifying the hydrogen-bond network even outside its second solvation shell. We found that a distinctive fingerprint of hydrogen bonding modification is the change in polarizability of water molecules. Molecular dipole moments are instead insensitive probes of long-range modifications induced by Na+ and Cl– ions. Though noticeable, the long-range effect of Cl– is expected to be too weak to affect solubility of large biomolecules.},

This assignment, in turn, corresponds to ΔhydH°(H+) = −1078 kJ mol-1 according to a self-consistent analysis of Krestov. Using these values, as a main result, the anions are more strongly hydrated than usually thought, in line with recent calculations. Only the group 1, 2, and 15 nobel gas ions are dealt with. For each series, the conventional enthalpies and entropies are linearly related to one another. From these linear free energy relationships (LFERs) a relationship between S°(Haq+) and ΔhydH°(H+) is derived. Further, a connection is detected between the Born radii rB, calculated from the free energies of hydration, and the distances d, corresponding to the upper limits of the experimental first peak position of the ionoxygen radial distribution curves, upon implication, in the case of a cation, the covalent radius rcov of oxygen, and in the case of an anion, the water radius rwater, Finally, from the differences between the enthalpies and free energies of hydration the temperature derivatives of the Born radii are determined.},

  abstract  = {In free energy calculations based on thermodynamic integration, it is necessary to compute the derivatives of the free energy as a function of one (scalar case) or several (vector case) order parameters. We derive in a compact way a general formulation for evaluating these derivatives as the average of a mean force acting on the order parameters, which involves first derivatives with respect to both Cartesian coordinates and time. This is in contrast with the previously derived formulas, which require first and second derivatives of the order parameter with respect to Cartesian coordinates. As illustrated in a concrete example, the main advantage of this new formulation is the simplicity of its use, especially for complicated order parameters. It is also straightforward to implement in a molecular dynamics code, as can be seen from the pseudocode given at the end. We further discuss how the approach based on time derivatives can be combined with the adaptive biasing force method, an enhanced sampling technique that rapidly yields uniform sampling of the order parameters, and by doing so greatly improves the efficiency of free energy calculations. Using the backbone dihedral angles ΦΦ and ΨΨ in N-acetylalanyl-N′N′-methylamide as a numerical example, we present a technique to reconstruct the free energy from its derivatives, a calculation that presents some difficulties in the vector case because of the statistical errors affecting the derivatives.},

Here, we apply the weighted ensemble path sampling approach to improve the efficiency of explicit solvent molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in sampling molecular association events between two methane molecules, Na+ and Cl− ions, methane and benzene, and the K+ ion and 18-crown-6 ether. Relative to brute force simulation, we obtain efficiency gains of at least 300 and 1100-fold for the most challenging system, K+/18-crown-6 ether, in terms of sampling the association rate constant k and distribution of times required to traverse transition paths, respectively. Our results indicate that weighted ensemble sampling is likely to allow for even greater efficiencies for more complex systems with higher barriers to molecular association.},

The simulations make use of the three‐site polarizable water model of Dang [J. Chem. Phys. 97, 2659 (1992)], which accurately reproduces many bulk water properties. The model’s static dielectric constant and relaxation behavior have been calculated and found to be in reasonable agreement with experimental results. The ion–water interaction potentials have been constructed through fitting to both experimental gas‐phase binding enthalpies for small ion–water clusters and to the measured structures and solvation enthalpies of ionic solutions. Structural properties and the potential of mean force for sodium chloride in water have been calculated. In addition, Grote–Hynes theory has been used to predict dynamical features of contact ion‐pair dissociation. All of the calculated ionic solution properties have been compared with results from simulations using the extended simple point charge (SPC/E), nonpolarizable water model [J. Phys. Chem. 91, 6296 (1987)]. The dependence on polarizability is found to be small, yet measurable, with the largest effects seen in the solvation structure around the highly polarizable chlorine anion. This work validates the use of some nonpolarizable water models in simulations of many condensed‐phase systems of chemical and biochemical interest.},

The pairing preferences reflected in these plots largely agree with the empirical rule of matching ion sizes in the small and big size regions. In the region that the ion sizes are close to the size of the water molecule; however, a significant deviation from this conventional rule is observed. Our further analysis indicated that this deviation originates from the competition between CIP and the water bridging SIP state. The competition is mainly an enthalpy modulated phenomenon in which the existing of the water bridging plays a significant role.},

The process we investigate, dissociation of a model Na+Cl- ion pair in water, involves a wide range of transition pathways in which collective solvent motions play an important role. Transition states along these pathways encompass a broad distribution of ionic separations. Ion pairs in contact remain associated for ∼20 ps on average, a time scale considerably longer than the ∼3ps predicted by transition state theory with ionic separation as the order parameter. In contrast to theories of barrier crossing based upon frictional effects (with or without memory), we find that the discrepancy between these time scales arises from neglected solvent free energy barriers rather than stochastic buffeting of the ion pair.},

We describe an efficient approach for a deterministic enumeration of ring conformations. We demonstrate a drastic improvement in dimensionality reduction with the use of nonlinear methods. We discuss the use of dimensionality reduction algorithms for estimating intrinsic dimensionality and the relationship to the Whitney embedding theorem. Additionally, we investigate the influence of the choice of high-dimensional encoding on the reduction. We show for the case studied that, in terms of reconstruction error root mean square deviation, Cartesian coordinate representations and encodings based on interatom distances provide better performance than encodings based on a dihedral angle representation.},

A recently introduced method of metadynamics allows exploration of the free energy surface of a molecular system by means of coarse-grained dynamics with flooding of free energy minima. This free energy surface is defined as a function of a set of collective variables (e.g., interatomic distances, angles, torsions, and others). In this study, essential coordinates determined by essential dynamics (principle component analysis) were used as collective variables in metadynamics. First, dynamics of the model system (explicitly solvated alanine dipeptide, Ace-Ala-Nme) was simulated by a classical molecular dynamics simulation. The trajectory (1 ns) was then analyzed by essential dynamics to obtain essential coordinates. The free energy surface as a function of the first and second essential coordinates was then explored by metadynamics. The resulting free energy surface is in agreement with other studies of this system. We propose that a combination of these two methods (metadynamics and essential dynamics) has great potential in studies of conformational changes in peptides and proteins.},

Metadynamics employing the three-dimensional embeddings as collective variables was applied to explore all relevant conformations of the studied system and to calculate its conformational free energy surface. The method sampled all relevant conformations (boat, boat-chair, and crown) and corresponding transition structures inaccessible by an unbiased simulation. This scheme allows to use essentially any parameter of the system as a collective variable in biased simulations. Moreover, the scheme we used for mapping out-of-sample conformations from the 72D to 3D space can be used as a general purpose mapping for dimensionality reduction, beyond the context of molecular modeling.},

  abstract  = {Biased simulations have great potential for the study of slow processes, including protein folding. Atomic motions in molecules are nonlinear, which suggests that simulations with enhanced sampling of collective motions traced by nonlinear dimensionality reduction methods may perform better than linear ones. In this study, we compare an unbiased folding simulation of the Trp-cage miniprotein with metadynamics simulations using both linear (principle component analysis) and nonlinear (Isomap) low dimensional embeddings as collective variables. Folding of the mini-protein was successfully simulated in 200 ns simulation with linear biasing and non-linear motion biasing. The folded state was correctly predicted as the free energy minimum in both simulations. We found that the advantage of linear motion biasing is that it can sample a larger conformational space, whereas the advantage of nonlinear motion biasing lies in slightly better resolution of the resulting free energy surface. In terms of sampling efficiency, both methods are comparable.},

We show evidence, from an examination of the distribution of pairwise distances between frames, that some features of the free-energy surface are inherently high-dimensional. This makes dimensionality reduction problematic because the data does not satisfy the assumptions made in conventional manifold learning algorithms We therefore propose that when dimensionality reduction is performed on trajectory data one should think of the resultant embedding as a quickly sketched set of directions rather than a road map. In other words, the embedding tells one about the connectivity between states but does not provide the vectors that correspond to the slow degrees of freedom. This realization informs the development of sketch-map, which endeavors to reproduce the proximity information from the high-dimensionality description in a space of lower dimensionality even when a faithful embedding is not possible.},

The ensemble of configurations explored is analyzed using the recently proposed sketch-map algorithm. Further simulations allow us to probe how mutations affect the structures adopted by this protein. We find that many of the configurations adopted by a mutant are the same as those adopted by the wild-type protein. Furthermore, certain mutations destabilize secondary-structure-containing configurations by preventing the formation of hydrogen bonds or by promoting the formation of new intramolecular contacts. Our analysis demonstrates that machine-learning techniques can be used to study the energy landscapes of complex molecules and that the visualizations that are generated in this way provide a natural basis for examining how the stabilities of particular configurations of the molecule are affected by factors such as temperature or structural mutations.},

A vast array of enhanced-sampling methods are based on the identification and biasing of these low-dimensional order parameters, whose fluctuations are important in driving rare events of interest. Here, we describe a new algorithm for finding optimal low-dimensional CVs for use in enhanced-sampling biasing methods like umbrella sampling, metadynamics, and related methods, when limited prior static and dynamic information is known about the system, and a much larger set of candidate CVs is specified. The algorithm involves estimating the best combination of these candidate CVs, as quantified by a maximum path entropy estimate of the spectral gap for dynamics viewed as a function of that CV. The algorithm is called spectral gap optimization of order parameters (SGOOP). Through multiple practical examples, we show how this postprocessing procedure can lead to optimization of CV and several orders of magnitude improvement in the convergence of the free energy calculated through metadynamics, essentially giving the ability to extract useful information even from unsuccessful metadynamics runs.},

The choice of CVs in these simulations is essential because it affects simulation results and impacts the free-energy profile, the minimum free-energy pathway (MFEP), and the transition-state structure. Here we examine how many CVs are required to capture the correct transition-state structure during the open-to-close motion of adenylate kinase using a coarse-grained model in the mean forces string method to search the MFEP. Various numbers of large amplitude principal components are tested as CVs in the simulations. The incorporation of local coordinates into CVs, which is possible in higher dimensional CV spaces, is important for capturing a reliable MFEP. The Bayesian measure proposed by Best and Hummer is sensitive to the choice of CVs, showing sharp peaks when the transition-state structure is captured. We thus evaluate the required number of CVs needed in enhanced sampling simulations for describing protein conformational changes.},

  abstract  = {Metadynamics is an established sampling method aimed at reconstructing the free-energy surface relative to a set of appropriately chosen collective variables. In standard metadynamics, the free-energy surface is filled by the addition of Gaussian potentials of preassigned and typically diagonal covariance. Asymptotically the free-energy surface is proportional to the bias deposited. Here, we consider the possibility of using Gaussians whose variance is adjusted on the fly to the local properties of the free-energy surface. We suggest two different prescriptions: one is based on the local diffusivity and the other on the local geometrical properties. We further examine the problem of extracting the free-energy surface when using adaptive Gaussians. We show that the standard relation between the bias and the free energy does not hold. In the limit of narrow Gaussians an explicit correction can be evaluated. In the general case, we propose to use instead a relation between bias and free energy borrowed from umbrella sampling. This relation holds for all kinds of incrementally deposited bias. We illustrate on the case of alanine dipeptide the advantage of using adaptive Gaussians in conjunction with the new free-energy estimator both in terms of accuracy and speed of convergence.},

The first hydration shell associated with the first maximum of the radial distribution function, gFeO(r), at d(Fe−OI) = 2.11−2.15 Å, contains 6 waters with average d(OH) = 0.99 Å, in good agreement with observations. A second shell with average coordination number 13.3 can be identified with average shell radius of d(Fe−OII) = 4.21−4.32 Å. The waters in this hydration shell are coordinated to the first shell via a trigonal H-bond network with d(OI−OII) = 2.7−2.9 Å, also in agreement with experimental measurements. The first shell tilt angle average is 33.4° as compared to the reported value of 41°. Wannier−Boys orbitals (WBO) show an interaction between the unoccupied 3d orbitals of the Fe3+ valence (spin up, 3d5) and the occupied spin down lone pair orbitals of first shell waters. The effect of the spin ordering of the Fe3+ ion on the WBO is not observed beyond the first shell. From this local bond analysis and consistent with other observations, the electronic structure of waters in the second shell is similar to that of a bulk water even in this strongly interacting system. H-bond decomposition shows significant bulk-like structure within the second shell for Fe3+. The vibrational density of states shows a first shell red shift of 230 cm−1 for the v1,2v2,v3 overtone, in reasonable agreement with experimental estimates for trivalent cations (300 cm−1). No exchanges between first and second shell were observed. Waters in the second shell exchanged with bulk waters via dissociative and associative mechanisms. Results are compared with an AIMD study of Al3+ and 64 waters. For Fe3+ the average first shell tilt angle is larger and the tilt angle distribution wider. H-bond decomposition shows that second shell to second shell H-bonding is enhanced in Fe3+ suggesting an earlier onset of bulk-like water structure.},

DFT+GGA MD methods provide a high level of agreement. However, improvements are observed when exact exchange is included. Higher accuracy in the pseudopotential description of the atomic potential, including core polarization and reducing core radii, was necessary for very detailed agreement. The first-principles nature of this approach supports its application to more complex systems.},

We have used 2DIR spectroscopy to study the equilibrium dynamics of thiocyanate chemical exchange between free ion (NCS–) and contact ion pair configurations (MNCS+), where M2+ = Mg2+ or Ca2+. Detailed studies of the influence of anion concentration and anion speciation show that the chemical exchange observed with the 2DIR measurements results from NCS– exchanging with other anion species in the first solvation shell surrounding Mg2+ or Ca2+. The presence of chemical exchange in the 2DIR spectra provides an indirect, but robust, determinant of contact ion pair formation. We observe preferential contact ion pair formation between soft Lewis base anions and hard Lewis acid cations. This observation cannot be easily reconciled with Pearson’s acid–base concept or Collins’ Law of Matching Water Affinities. The anions that form contact ion pairs also correspond to the ions with an affinity for water and protein surfaces, so similar physical and chemical properties may control these distinct phenomena.},

From the point of view of computer simulation, there is need for a force field that can reproduce the structural and dynamical properties of this solution, and more importantly it is also simple enough to use in large scale simulations of supercooled states. We study by molecular dynamics the structure of the LiCl–water solutions with the force field proposed by Joung and Cheatham (J. Phys. Chem. B 2008, 112, 9020) appropriate for the water TIP4P-Ew model potential. We found that this force field does not reproduce the experimental ion pairing when the Lorentz–Berthelot (LB) rules are used. By incorporating deviations to the LB rules to obtain the crossed interactions between the ions, it is possible to get agreement with experiment. We have studied how the modification of the LB rule affects the structural and thermodynamic properties of the solution at increasing concentration of the solution from the low (around 2%) to medium (around 14%) concentration regimes. We also tested the transferability of the Joung and Cheatham force field to the water TIP4P/2005 model that works very well for supercooled water.},

  abstract  = {In this study, we investigate the thermodynamics of alkali nitrate salt solutions, especially the formation of contact ion pairs between alkali cation and nitrate anion. The ion-pairing propensity shows an order of LiNO3 < NaNO3 < KNO3. Such results explain the salt activity coefficients and suggest that the empirical “law of matching water affinity” is followed by these alkali nitrate salt solutions. The spatial patterns of contact ion pairs are different in the three salt solutions studied here: Li+ forms the contact ion pair with only one oxygen of the nitrate while Na+ and K+ can also be shared by two oxygens of the nitrate. In reproducing the salt activity coefficient using Kirkwood–Buff theory, we find that it is essential to include electronic polarization for Li+ which has a high charge density. The electronic continuum correction for nonpolarizable force field significantly improves the agreement between the calculated activity coefficients and their experimental values. This approach also improves the performance of the force field on salt solubility. From these two aspects, this study suggests that electronic continuum correction can be a promising approach to force-field development for ions with high charge densities.},

Classification of many ions as “structure makers” and “structure breakers” has been based in part on corresponding changes in the vibrational spectra (Raman and IR). Here we show that changes in O−H vibrational spectra induced by the alkali halides in liquid water result instead from the actions of ions' electric fields on adjacent water molecules. Computer simulations that accurately reproduce our experimental measurements suggest that the statistics of hydrogen-bond strengths are only weakly modified beyond this first solvation shell.},

A combined ultrafast 2D IR and pump/probe study through vibrational energy transfers directly observes ion clustering in aqueous solutions of LiSCN, NaSCN, KSCN and CsSCN. In a near saturated KSCN aqueous solution (water/KSCN molar ratio = 2.4/1), 95% of the anions form ion clusters. Diluting the solution results in fewer, smaller, and tighter clusters. Cations have significant effects on cluster formation. A small cation results in smaller and fewer clusters. The vibrational energy transfer method holds promise for studying a wide variety of other fast short-range molecular interactions.},

  abstract  = {The short-time orientational relaxation of water is studied by ultrafast infrared pump-probe spectroscopy of the hydroxyl stretching mode (OD of dilute HOD in H2O). The anisotropy decay displays a sharp drop at very short times caused by inertial orientational motion, followed by a much slower decay that fully randomizes the orientation. Investigation of temperatures from 1°C to 65°C shows that the amplitude of the inertial component (extent of inertial angular displacement) depends strongly on the stretching frequency of the OD oscillator at higher temperatures, although the slow component is frequency-independent. The inertial component becomes frequency-independent at low temperatures. At high temperatures there is a correlation between the amplitude of the inertial decay and the strength of the O-DO hydrogen bond, but at low temperatures the correlation disappears, showing that a single hydrogen bond (ODO) is no longer a significant determinant of the inertial angular motion. It is suggested that the loss of correlation at lower temperatures is caused by the increased importance of collective effects of the extended hydrogen bonding network. By using a new harmonic cone model, the experimentally measured amplitudes of the inertial decays yield estimates of the characteristic frequencies of the intermolecular angular potential for various strengths of hydrogen bonds. The frequencies are in the range of ≈400 cm−1. A comparison with recent molecular dynamics simulations employing the simple point charge-extended water model at room temperature shows that the simulations qualitatively reflect the correlation between the inertial decay and the OD stretching frequency.},

The hydration structures of the different carbonate species depend on their ability to accept and donate H-bonds with H2O. The H-bonds donated by the C−O−H sites of the carbonate species to water molecules are generally stronger and longer-lived than those accepted by these sites from water molecules. The structural relaxation among the water molecules is dominated by diffusional (translational) motion of H2O, whereas the H-bond reorganization is dominated by the librational motion of the water molecules and the carbonate species. The rates of structural relaxation of the H2O molecules and the rates of H-bond reorganization among them are slower in systems containing carbonate species, consistent with previous studies of simple salt solutions. The strengths and lifetimes of H-bonds involving the carbonate species positively correlate with the total negative charge on the species. H-bond donation from H2O to CO2 is weak, but the presence of CO2 noticeably affects the structure and structural relaxation of the surrounding H-bonding network leading to generally stronger H-bonds and slower relaxation rates, the behavior typical of a hydrophobic solute.},

  abstract  = {Raman spectroscopy in combination with multivariate curve resolution (Raman-MCR) is used to explore the interaction between water and various kosmotropic and chaotropic anions. Raman-MCR of aqueous Na-salt (NaI, NaBr, NaNO3, Na2SO4, and Na3PO4) solutions provides solute-correlated Raman spectra (SC-spectra) of water. The SC-spectra predominantly bear the vibrational characteristics of water in the hydration shell of anions, because Na+-cation has negligible effect on the OH stretch band of water. The SC-spectra for the chaotropic I–, Br–, and NO3– anions and even for the kosmotropic SO42– anion resemble the Raman spectrum of isotopically diluted water (H2O/D2O = 1/19; v/v) whose OH stretch band is largely comprised by the response of vibrationally decoupled OH oscillators. On the other hand, the SC-spectrum for the kosmotropic PO43– anion is quite similar to the Raman spectrum of H2O (bulk). Comparison of the peak positions of SC-spectra and the Raman spectrum of isotopically diluted water suggests that the hydrogen bond strength of water in the hydration shell of SO42– is comparable to that of the isotopically diluted water, but that in the hydration shell of I–, Br–, and NO3– anions is weaker than that of the latter. Analysis of integrated area of component bands of the SC-spectra reveals ∼80% reduction of the delocalization of vibrational modes (intermolecular coupling and Fermi resonance) of water in the hydration shell of I–, Br–, NO3–, and SO42– anions. In the case of trivalent PO43–, the vibrational delocalization is presumably reduced and the corresponding decrease in spectral response at ∼3250 cm–1 is compensated by the increased signal of strongly hydrogen bonded (but decoupled) water species in the hydration shell. The peak area-averaged wavenumber of the SC-spectrum increases as PO43– < SO42– < NO3– < Br– < I– and indeed suggests strong hydrogen bonding of water in the hydration shell of PO43– anion.},

The method proceeds by evolving strings, i.e., smooth curves with intrinsic parametrization whose dynamics takes them to the most probable transition path between two metastable regions in configuration space. Free energy barriers and transition rates can then be determined by a standard umbrella sampling around the string. Applications to Lennard-Jones cluster rearrangement and thermally induced switching of a magnetic film are presented.},

  abstract  = {In this work, molecular simulation techniques were employed to gain insight into the structural, kinetic, and thermodynamic properties of the uranyl(VI) cation (UO22+) in aqueous solution. The simulations made use of an atomistic potential model (force field) derived in this work and based on the model of Guilbaud and Wipff [ J. Mol. Struct. (THEOCHEM) 1996, 366, 55−63]. Reactive flux and thermodynamic integration calculations show that the derived potential model yields predictions for the water exchange rate and free energy of hydration, respectively, that are in agreement with experimental data. The water binding energies, hydration shell structure, and self-diffusion coefficient were also calculated and analyzed. Finally, a combination of metadynamics and transition path sampling simulations was employed to probe the mechanisms of water exchange reactions in the first hydration shell of the uranyl ion. These atomistic simulations indicate, based on two-dimensional free energy surfaces, that water exchanges follow an associative interchange mechanism. The nature and structure of the water exchange transition states were also determined. The improved potential model is expected to lead to more accurate predictions of uranyl adsorption energies at mineral surfaces using potential-based molecular dynamics simulations.},

  abstract  = {Lithium-ion solvation and diffusion properties in ethylene carbonate (EC) and propylene carbonate (PC) were studied by molecular simulation, experiments, and electronic structure calculations. Studies carried out in water provide a reference for interpretation. Classical molecular dynamics simulation results are compared to ab initio molecular dynamics to assess nonpolarizable force field parameters for solvation structure of the carbonate solvents. Quasi-chemical theory (QCT) was adapted to take advantage of fourfold occupancy of the near-neighbor solvation structure observed in simulations and used to calculate solvation free energies. The computed free energy for transfer of Li+ to PC from water, based on electronic structure calculations with cluster-QCT, agrees with the experimental value. The simulation-based direct-QCT results with scaled partial charges agree with the electronic structure-based QCT values. The computed Li+/PF6– transference numbers of 0.35/0.65 (EC) and 0.31/0.69 (PC) agree well with NMR experimental values of 0.31/0.69 (EC) and 0.34/0.66 (PC) and similar values obtained here with impedance spectroscopy. These combined results demonstrate that solvent partial charges can be scaled in systems dominated by strong electrostatic interactions to achieve trends in ion solvation and transport properties that are comparable to ab initio and experimental results. Thus, the results support the use of scaled partial charges in simple, nonpolarizable force fields in future studies of these electrolyte solutions.},

Despite much experimental progress, understanding THz spectra in terms of molecular motions, akin to mid-infrared spectra, still remains elusive. Here, using the osmoprotectant glycine as a showcase, we demonstrate how this can be achieved by combining THz absorption spectroscopy and ab initio molecular dynamics. The experimental THz spectrum is characterized by broad yet clearly discernible peaks. Based on substantial extensions of available mode-specific decomposition schemes, the experimental spectrum can be reproduced by theory and assigned on an essentially quantitative level. This joint effort reveals an unexpectedly clear picture of the individual contributions of molecular motion to the THz absorption spectrum in terms of distinct modes stemming from intramolecular vibrations, rigid-body-like hindered rotational and translational motion, and specific couplings to interfacial water molecules. The assignment is confirmed by the peak shifts observed in the THz spectrum of deuterated glycine in heavy water, which allow us to separate the distinct modes experimentally.},

  abstract  = {Understanding aqueous interfaces at the molecular level is not only fundamentally important, but also highly relevant for a variety of disciplines. For instance, electrode–water interfaces are relevant for electrochemistry, as are mineral–water interfaces for geochemistry and air–water interfaces for environmental chemistry; water–lipid interfaces constitute the boundaries of the cell membrane, and are thus relevant for biochemistry. One of the major challenges in these fields is to link macroscopic properties such as interfacial reactivity, solubility, and permeability as well as macroscopic thermodynamic and spectroscopic observables to the structure, structural changes, and dynamics of molecules at these interfaces. Simulations, by themselves, or in conjunction with appropriate experiments, can provide such molecular-level insights into aqueous interfaces. In this contribution, we review the current state-of-the-art of three levels of molecular dynamics (MD) simulation: ab initio, force field, and coarse-grained. We discuss the advantages, the potential, and the limitations of each approach for studying aqueous interfaces, by assessing computations of the sum-frequency generation spectra and surface tension. The comparison of experimental and simulation data provides information on the challenges of future MD simulations, such as improving the force field models and the van der Waals corrections in ab initio MD simulations. Once good agreement between experimental observables and simulation can be established, the simulation can be used to provide insights into the processes at a level of detail that is generally inaccessible to experiments. As an example we discuss the mechanism of the evaporation of water. We finish by presenting an outlook outlining four future challenges for molecular dynamics simulations of aqueous interfacial systems.},

Thermal effects are treated by averaging the spectra of molecular configurations generated by an ab initio molecular-dynamics simulation where solvent molecules are treated explicitly. Dielectric effects are then dealt with implicitly by computing the spectra upon removal of the solvent molecules and their replacement with an effective medium, in the spirit of a continuum solvation model. Our multimodel approach is validated by comparing its predictions with those of a fully explicit-solvation simulation for cyanidin-3-glucoside (cyanin) chromophore in water. While multimodel and fully explicit-solvent spectra may differ considerably for individual configurations along the trajectory, their time averages are remarkably similar, thus providing a solid benchmark of the former and allowing us to save considerably on the computer resources needed to predict accurate absorption spectra. The power of the proposed methodology is finally demonstrated by the excellent agreement between its predictions and the absorption spectra of cyanin measured at strong and intermediate acidity conditions.},

Using both static first-principles calculations and ab initio molecular dynamics, we perform a comprehensive adsorption study of several salt and solvent species at the interface of Mg metal with an electrolyte of Mg2+ and Cl– dissolved in liquid tetrahydrofuran (THF). Our findings not only provide a picture of the stable species at the interface but also explain how this system can support reversible Mg deposition, and as such, we provide insights in how to design other electrolytes for Mg plating and stripping. The active depositing species are identified to be (MgCl)+ monomers coordinated by THF, which exhibit preferential adsorption on Mg compared to possible passivating species (such as THF solvent or neutral MgCl2 complexes). Upon deposition, the energy to desolvate these adsorbed complexes and facilitate charge transfer is shown to be small (∼61–46.2 kJ mol–1 to remove three THF from the strongest adsorbing complex), and the stable orientations of the adsorbed but desolvated (MgCl)+ complexes appear to be favorable for charge transfer. Finally, observations of Mg–Cl dissociation at the Mg surface at very low THF coordinations (0 and 1) suggest that deleterious Cl incorporation in the anode may occur upon plating. In the stripping process, this is beneficial by further facilitating the Mg removal reaction.},

Although screening is motivated by numerical considerations, it is also related to separations in the length- and timescales characterizing forces in a molecular system: Loose thresholds are sufficient to describe fast motions over short distances, while tight thresholds may be employed for larger length scales and longer times, leading to a practical acceleration of ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. Standard screening approaches can lead, however, to significant discontinuities in (and inconsistencies between) the energy and gradient when the screening threshold is loose, making them inappropriate for use in dynamics. To remedy this problem, a consistent window-screening method that smooths these discontinuities is devised. Further algorithmic improvements reuse electronic-structure information within the dynamics step and enhance efficiency relative to a naı̈ve multiple-timestepping protocol. The resulting scheme is shown to realize meaningful reductions in the cost of Hartree–Fock and B3LYP simulations of a moderately large system, the protonated sarcosine/glycine dipeptide embedded in a 19-water cluster.},

The dynamics trajectories are obtained using both Born–Oppenheimer and extended Lagrangian (Car–Parrinello-style) options, and hence, here, for the first time, we present Car–Parrinello-like AIMD trajectories that are accurate to the CCSD level of post-Hartree–Fock theory. The specific extended Lagrangian implementation used here is a generalization to atom-centered density matrix propagation (ADMP) that provides post-Hartree–Fock accuracy, and hence the new method is abbreviated as ADMP-pHF; whereas the Born–Oppenheimer version is called frag-BOMD. The fragmentation methodology is based on a set-theoretic, inclusion-exclusion principle based generalization of the well-known ONIOM method. Thus, the fragmentation scheme contains multiple overlapping “model” systems, and overcounting is compensated through the inclusion-exclusion principle. The energy functional thus obtained is used to construct Born–Oppenheimer forces (frag-BOMD) and is also embedded within an extended Lagrangian (ADMP-pHF). The dynamics is tested by computing structural and vibrational properties for protonated water clusters. The frag-BOMD trajectories yield structural and vibrational properties in excellent agreement with full CCSD-based “on-the-fly” BOMD trajectories, at a small fraction of the cost. The asymptotic (large system) computational scaling of both frag-BOMD and ADMP-pHF is inferred as , for on-the-fly CCSD accuracy. The extended Lagrangian implementation, ADMP-pHF, also provides structural features in excellent agreement with full “on-the-fly” CCSD calculations, but the dynamical frequencies are slightly red-shifted. Furthermore, we study the behavior of ADMP-pHF as a function of the electronic inertia tensor and find a monotonic improvement in the red-shift as we reduce the electronic inertia. In all cases a uniform spectral scaling factor, that in our preliminary studies appears to be independent of system and independent of level of theory (same scaling factor for both MP2 and CCSD implementations ADMP-pHF and for ADMP DFT), improves on agreement between ADMP-pHF and full CCSD calculations. Hence, we believe both frag-BOMD and ADMP-pHF will find significant utility in modeling complex systems. The computational power of frag-BOMD and ADMP-pHF is demonstrated through preliminary studies on a much larger protonated 21-water cluster, for which AIMD trajectories with “on-the-fly” CCSD are not feasible.},

Through the calculations this channel emerges as an H-atom transfer process to the hydroxyl or alkoxy radical species from neighboring solvent molecules, which are activated as the presolvated electron occupies their antibonding orbitals.

  abstract  = {The detailed knowledge of excited state proton transfer mechanisms in complex environments is of paramount importance in chemistry. However, the definition of an effective reaction coordinate and the understanding of the driving force of the reaction can be difficult from both the experimental and the theoretical points of view. Here we analyzed by theoretical approaches the mechanism and the driving forces of the excited state proton transfer reaction occurring between the 7-hydroxy-4-(trifluoromethyl)coumarin photoacid and the 1-methylimidazole base molecules in toluene solution. In particular, we compared the intrinsic and the dynamical reaction pathways, obtained by integrating the reaction coordinate, and by performing ab initio simulations of molecular dynamics, respectively. Time-dependent density functional theory and polarizable solvation continuum models were adopted to define the excited state potential energy surface. Results were analyzed by means of the DCT electronic density based index. Our findings suggest that the reaction coordinate is mainly composed of several intra- and intermolecular modes of the reactants. An analysis of both the intrinsic coordinate and the dynamical results shows that the charge transfer induced by electronic excitation of the coumarin molecule is the main proton transfer driving force. With regards to the methodological validation, the combination of ab initio molecular dynamics with time-dependent density functional theory appears to be feasible and reliable to study excited state proton transfer reactions in the condensed phase.},

AIMD confirms formation of Men, where n ranges from 2 to 4. High pressure sharply favors larger structures, whereas high temperature decreases their fraction. Heavier alkali metals maintain somewhat larger fractions of Me2, Me3, and Me4, relative to isolated atoms. A single atom is the most frequently observed structure in vapors, irrespective of the element and temperature. Due to technical difficulties of working with high temperatures and pressures in experiments, AIMD is the most affordable method of research. It provides valuable understanding of the chemical behavior of Li, Na, K, Rb, and Cs, which can lead to development of new chemical reactions involving these metals.},

As shown for N2 + Ru(0001), which is a prototypical case for highly activated dissociative chemisorption, the method allows an accurate description of the coupling of molecular and surface atom motion and accurately accounts for vibrational properties of the employed slab model of Ru(0001). The neural network potential allows reaction probabilities as low as 10–5 to be computed, showing good agreement with experimental results.},

Our results reveal that while the hydration-shell of CO2 is highly tetrahedral, it is also occasionally disrupted by the presence of entropically stabilized defects associated with the CO2-water hydrogen bond. Moreover, we find that the hydration-shell of CO2 undergoes a temperature-dependent structural transformation to a highly disordered (less tetrahedral) structure, reminiscent of the transformation that takes place at higher temperatures around much larger oily molecules. The biological significance of the CO2 hydration shell structural transformation is suggested by the fact that it takes place near physiological temperatures.},

Here, we present direct ab initio molecular dynamics simulation evidence of the formation of ammonium bisulfate (NH4HSO4) from the hydrated NH3 and SO3 molecules in a water trimer as well as on the surface of a water droplet. This reaction suggests a new mechanism for the formation of ammonium sulfate in the atmosphere, especially when the concentration of NH3 is high (e.g., ∼10 μg m–3) in the air. Contrary to the water monomer and dimer, the water trimer enables near-barrierless proton transfer via the formation of a unique loop structure around the reaction center. The formation of the loop structure promotes the splitting of a water molecule in the proton-transfer center, resulting in the generation a NH4+/HSO4– ion pair. The loop-structure promoted proton-transfer mechanism is expected to be ubiquitous on the surface of cloud droplets with adsorbed NH3 and SO3 molecules and, thus, may play an important role in the nucleation of aerosol particles (e.g., fine particles PM2.5) in water droplets.},

This is demonstrated with AIMD calculations on CHD3 + Ni(111) in which the SRP functional is fitted to supersonic beam experiments, and validated by showing that AIMD with the resulting functional reproduces initial-state selected sticking measurements with chemical accuracy (4.2 kJ/mol ≈ 1 kcal/mol).

This species was chosen because it features both a nonconventional C–Br–Br bonding pattern, as well as a strong dependence of its spectral features on the local environment in which it resides, as illustrated in recent experimental reports. We simulate the UV–vis and IR spectra of iso-CHBr3 in the gas phase, as well as in a Ne cluster (64 atoms) and in a methylcyclohexane cage (14 solvent molecules) representative of the previously characterized matrix isolated and solvated iso-CHBr3 species. We exclusively perform fully quantum mechanical static and dynamic simulations. By comparing our condensed phase simulations to their experimental analogues, we stress the importance of (i) conformational sampling, even at cryogenic temperatures, and (ii) using a fully quantum mechanical description of both solute and bath to properly account for the experimental observables.},

By decomposing the O–D groups of the D2O molecules into specific subensembles, we reveal that water reorientational dynamics are retarded considerably in the vicinity of the hydrophilic TMAO oxygen (OTMAO) atom, due to the O–D···OTMAO hydrogen-bond. We find that this reorientational motion is governed by two distinct mechanisms: The O–D group rotates (1) after breaking the O–D···OTMAO hydrogen-bond, or (2) together with the TMAO molecule while keeping this hydrogen-bond intact. While the orientational slow-down is prominent in the AIMD simulation, simulations based on force field models exhibit much faster dynamics. The simulated angle-resolved radial distribution functions illustrate that the O–D···OTMAO hydrogen-bond has a strong directionality through the sp3 orbital configuration in the AIMD simulation, and this directionality is not properly accounted for in the force field simulation. These results imply that care must be taken when modeling negatively charged oxygen atoms as single point charges; force field models may not adequately describe the hydration configuration and dynamics.},

  abstract  = {The infrared (IR) spectrum of the ammoniated ammonium dimer is more complex than those of the larger protonated ammonia clusters due to close-lying fundamental and combination bands and possible Fermi resonances (FR). To date, the only theoretical analysis involved partial dimensionality quantum nuclear dynamic simulations, assuming a symmetric structure (D3d) with the proton midway between the two nitrogen atoms. Here we report an extensive study of the less symmetric (C3v) dimer, utilizing both second order vibrational perturbation theory (VPT2) and ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD), from which we calculated the Fourier transform (FT) of the dipole-moment autocorrelation function (DACF). The resultant IR spectrum was assigned using FTed velocity autocorrelation functions (VACFs) of several interatomic distances and angles. At 50 K, we have been able to assign all 21 AIMD fundamentals, in reasonable agreement with MP2-based VPT2, about 30 AIMD combination bands, and a difference band. The combinations involve a wag or the NN stretch as one of the components, and appear to follow symmetry selection rules. On this basis, we suggest possible assignments of the experimental spectrum. The VACF-analysis revealed two possible FR bands, one of which is the strongest peak in the computed spectrum. Raising the temperature to 180 K eliminated the “proton transfer mode” (PTM) fundamental, and reduced the number of observed combination bands and FRs. With increasing temperature, fundamentals red-shift, and the doubly degenerate wags exhibit larger anharmonic splittings in their VACF bending spectra. We have repeated the analysis for the H3ND+NH3 isotopologue, finding that it has a simplified spectrum, with all the strong peaks being fundamentals. Experimental study of this isotopologue may thus provide a good starting point for disentangling the N2H7+ spectrum.},

  abstract  = {Developing ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) methods for practical application in protein dynamics is of significant interest. Due to the large size of biomolecules, applying standard quantum chemical methods to compute energies for dynamic simulation is computationally prohibitive. In this work, a fragment based ab initio molecular dynamics approach is presented for practical application in protein dynamics study. In this approach, the energy and forces of the protein are calculated by a recently developed electrostatically embedded generalized molecular fractionation with conjugate caps (EE-GMFCC) method. For simulation in explicit solvent, mechanical embedding is introduced to treat protein interaction with explicit water molecules. This AIMD approach has been applied to MD simulations of a small benchmark protein Trpcage (with 20 residues and 304 atoms) in both the gas phase and in solution. Comparison to the simulation result using the AMBER force field shows that the AIMD gives a more stable protein structure in the simulation, indicating that quantum chemical energy is more reliable. Importantly, the present fragment-based AIMD simulation captures quantum effects including electrostatic polarization and charge transfer that are missing in standard classical MD simulations. The current approach is linear-scaling, trivially parallel, and applicable to performing the AIMD simulation of proteins with a large size.},

Observations of spontaneous deprotonation of aqueous carbamate zwitterions R1R2NHCOO± by bulk water (instead of additional amine, or via umbrella sampling) are reported apparently for the first time. Carbamic acid structures R1R2NCOOH were observed in some simulations, arising from zwitterions not via classical 1,3-H-shifts but via Grotthuss-style multiple-H+ transfer pathways that involve bulk H2O and require carbamate anions R1R2NCOO– as an intermediate stage along the way. H+-bridging complexes, including not only Zundel ions [water·H+·water]+ but neutral carbamate complexes [carbamate–·H+·water], were observed in simulation. These results should assist efforts in improving underlying mechanisms for kinetic modeling.},

The calculations showed that the neutral 1:1 complex SO2–H2O has a Cs symmetry and the sulfur of SO2 interacts with the oxygen of H2O with an eclipsed form. In the case of ionization of SO2–H2O 1:1 complex (n = 1), the cation complex composed of [H2O–SO2]+ with a face-to-face form was obtained as the product. The OH addition reactions to SO2 were found in larger systems (n = 2, 3, and 6) following the ionization. The reaction was expressed as SO2+(H2O)n → SO2(OH)···H+(H2O)n−1 (n = 2, 3, and 6). The proton generated as (SO2–H2O)+ → (HSO3) + H+ was stabilized by the second water molecule as the reaction: H+ + H2O → H3O+. These processes occurred and were completed within the cluster. The OH addition mechanism in SO2+(H2O)n cluster was discussed on the basis of the present results.},

Calculated profiles show minima corresponding to stable outer- and inner-sphere adsorbed structures. We analyzed the energetics and kinetics of most possible interfacial electron transfer reactions, as well as analyzing the same for subsurface migration pathways of injected electrons through calculating the Marcus free energy surfaces. We conclude that inner-sphere Fe(II)-complex formation is required for the interfacial electron transfer to occur, but the energetic cost of moving from the outer-sphere to inner-sphere geometry may prevent electron injection at some faces. We also show that some surfaces, especially (101), (100) and (001), are more energetically prone toward reduction than others. We demonstrate that subsurface charge migration in directions parallel to the surface, which run along the iron chains, is more energetically plausible than conduction through the resistive crystal bulk phase. Collectively this leads to the conclusion that Fe(II)-catalyzed recrystallization of goethite most likely proceeds by short path length electron migration through specific goethite surfaces along specific directions, until capture at Fe sites structurally susceptible to reduction and release.},

  abstract  = {Electrolyte interactions with nanoparticles (NPs) at the solid/liquid interfaces are highly complicated as the charged species can be directly adsorbed onto the NP surfaces, confined in the diffusion layer immediately surrounding the NPs, and dispersed in bulk solutions. Existing studies on electrolyte interactions with NPs are based primarily on the electrical double layer theory that focuses mainly on electrolyte interactions with NPs with fixed pre-existing charges. Demonstrated herein is a comprehensive study of counterion effects during the electrolyte bindings to gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), including halide-induced AuNP aggregation and fusion, quantitative cation and anion coadsorption, selective cation and anion displacement on AuNPs, and surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopic features of the ionic species adsorbed onto AuNP surfaces. In contradiction to previous reports that electrolyte effects are anion-specific, we demonstrated that cations can play a dominant role in the halide-induced AuNP aggregation and fusion and the ion-exchange processes on AuNP surfaces. Mechanistically, these counterion effects are due to the cooperative and competitive cation and anion binding to AuNPs and AuNP-facilitated cation and anion interactions. The insights provided in this work should be of broad importance for NP research and applications in which electrolyte/NP interactions are ubiquitously implicated.},

A similar compression appears ubiquitously in models taken from diverse areas of science, suggesting that the parameter space structure underlying effective continuum and universal theories in physics also permits predictive modeling more generally.},

Many such models are “sloppy,” i.e., exhibit behavior controlled by a relatively small number of parameter combinations. We review an information theoretic framework for analyzing sloppy models. This formalism is based on the Fisher information matrix, which is interpreted as a Riemannian metric on a parameterized space of models. Distance in this space is a measure of how distinguishable two models are based on their predictions. Sloppy model manifolds are bounded with a hierarchy of widths and extrinsic curvatures. The manifold boundary approximation can extract the simple, hidden theory from complicated sloppy models. We attribute the success of simple effective models in physics as likewise emerging from complicated processes exhibiting a low effective dimensionality. We discuss the ramifications and consequences of sloppy models for biochemistry and science more generally. We suggest that the reason our complex world is understandable is due to the same fundamental reason: simple theories of macroscopic behavior are hidden inside complicated microscopic processes.},

  abstract  = {Kohn-Sham density functional theory (DFT) has become established as an indispensable tool for investigating aqueous systems of all kinds, including those important in chemistry, surface science, biology, and the earth sciences. Nevertheless, many widely used approximations for the exchange-correlation (XC) functional describe the properties of pure water systems with an accuracy that is not fully satisfactory. The explicit inclusion of dispersion interactions generally improves the description, but there remain large disagreements between the predictions of different dispersion-inclusive methods. We present here a review of DFT work on water clusters, ice structures, and liquid water, with the aim of elucidating how the strengths and weaknesses of different XC approximations manifest themselves across this variety of water systems. Our review highlights the crucial role of dispersion in describing the delicate balance between compact and extended structures of many different water systems, including the liquid. By referring to a wide range of published work, we argue that the correct description of exchange-overlap interactions is also extremely important, so that the choice of semi-local or hybrid functional employed in dispersion-inclusive methods is crucial. The origins and consequences of beyond-2-body errors of approximate XC functionals are noted, and we also discuss the substantial differences between different representations of dispersion. We propose a simple numerical scoring system that rates the performance of different XC functionals in describing water systems, and we suggest possible future developments.},

  abstract  = {Following the general lines of Fuoss' early analysis, two alternate definitions of ion partners (1) excluding and (2) including partners composed of ions having the same electrical sign are formulated. The resulting sets of coupled integral equations for the ion‐partner radial distribution functions Gij(r), differ from Fuoss' by the inclusion of a factor for the probability that the orbital ion does not have a partner closer than the central ion and are valid for electrolytes of any symmetry type or any mixture of electrolytes at any concentration for which the ordinary pair correlation functions gij(r) for the various types of pairs of ions are known. By the presented iterative numerical method, the set of equations resulting from either definition (1) or (2) may be solved even for a general mixture. Explicit analytical solutions for Gij(r) in terms of an arbitrary (except for an easily relaxed restriction of a hard core) gij(r) are presented for the following electrolytes: definition (1) symmetrical and unsymmetrical binary; definition (2) symmetrical binary with equal ionic radii. For examples of these electrolytes, graphs of Gij(r) resulting from the use of the Debye‐Hückel model and the infinite dilution form of gij(r) are presented (cations, 10—4M; D=20; T=25°C; interionic distance of closest approach, 4.6 A). Numerically obtained Gij(r) are also presented for a 1–1 electrolyte with unequal ionic radii [definition (2); conditions as above except ionic radii of 1.6 A and 3.0 A] and a mixture of two 1–1 electrolytes with a common anion [definition (1); interionic distance of closest approach of the second electrolyte, 7.0 A]. More extensive ion pair formation of the smaller cation shown in the latter case qualitatively explains anomalously low conductance in mixtures. The Gij(r), markedly smaller than the corresponding Fuoss curve at large separation, lead to the same association constant K—1 if the same critical distance is used to terminate the ion pair range; a constant critical distance, however, leads to a K—1 which is a continuous function of DT in qualitative agreement with some conductance data and is compatible with a ``contact ion pair'' concept. An equation for the activity coefficient ratio is presented and degrees of association are calculated in a variety of solutions. The formalism presented easily accepts more realistic gij(r) functions and can be extended to entirely different types of systems. The usefulness of the ion (or particle) pair approach is briefly discussed.},

The simplest generalization, equivalent to a Poisson distribution model for inner-shell occupancy, exploits measurable interionic correlation functions, and is correct at the closest pair distances whether primitive electrolyte solutions models or molecularly detailed models are considered, and for low electrolyte concentrations in all cases. With detailed models, these generalizations include nonionic interactions and solvation effects. These generalizations are relevant for computational analysis of bimolecular reactive processes in solution. Comparisons with direct numerical simulation results show that the simplest generalization is accurate for a slightly supersaturated solution of tetraethylammonium tetrafluoroborate in propylene carbonate ([tea][BF4BF4]/PC), and also for a primitive model associated with the [tea][BF4BF4]/PC results. For [tea][BF4BF4]/PC, the atomically detailed results identify solvent-separated nearest-neighbor ion-pairs. This generalization is examined also for the ionic liquid 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate ([bmim][BF4BF4]) where the simplest implementation is less accurate. In this more challenging situation an augmented maximum entropy procedure is satisfactory, and explains the more varied near-neighbor distributions observed in that case.},

We investigated the resulting structure of the electrical double layer as well as the ensuing surface forces and differential capacitance, as a function of the degree of ion association. We found that the short-range structure adjacent to surfaces was remarkably unaffected by the degree of ion pairing, up to several molecular diameters. This was even the case for 100% of ions being paired. The physical implications of ion pairing only become apparent in equilibrium properties that depend upon the long-range screening of charges, such as the asymptotic behaviour of surface forces and the differential capacitance, especially at low surface potential. The effect of ion pairing on capacitance is consistent with their invocation as a source of the anomalous temperature dependence of the latter. This work shows that ion pairing effects on equilibrium properties are subtle and may be difficult to extract directly from simulations.},

  abstract  = {An asymmetric restricted primitive model (ARPM) of electrolytes is proposed as a simple three parameter (charge q, diameter d, and charge displacement b) model of ionic liquids and solutions. Charge displacement allows electrostatic and steric interactions to operate between different centres, so that orientational correlations arise in ion-ion interactions. In this way the ionic system may have partly the character of a simple ionic fluid/solid and of a polar fluid formed from ion pairs. The present exploration of the system focuses on the ion pair formation mechanism, the relative concentration of paired and free ions and the consequences for the cohesive energy, and the tendency to form fluid or solid phase. In contrast to studies of similar (though not identical) models in the past, we focus on behaviours at room temperature. By MC and MD simulations of such systems composed of monovalent ions of hard-sphere (or essentially hard-sphere) diameter equal to 5 Å and a charge displacement ranging from 0 to 2 Å from the hard-sphere origin, we find that ion pairing dominates for b larger than 1 Å. When b exceeds about 1.5 Å, the system is essentially a liquid of dipolar ion pairs with a small presence of free ions. We also investigate dielectric behaviours of corresponding liquids, composed of purely dipolar species. Many basic features of ionic liquids appear to be remarkably consistent with those of our ARPM at ambient conditions, when b is around 1 Å. However, the rate of self-diffusion and, to a lesser extent, conductivity is overestimated, presumably due to the simple spherical shape of our ions in the ARPM. The relative simplicity of our ARPM in relation to the rich variety of new mechanisms and properties it introduces, and to the numerical simplicity of its exploration by theory or simulation, makes it an essential step on the way towards representation of the full complexity of ionic liquids.},

Our strategy is based on simultaneous optimizing single-ion and ion-pair properties, i.e., we first fix ion-water parameters based on single-ion solvation free energies, and in a second step determine the cation-anion interaction parameters (traditionally given by mixing or combination rules) based on the Kirkwood-Buff theory without modification of the ion-water interaction parameters. In doing so, we have introduced scaling factors for the cation-anion Lennard-Jones (LJ) interaction that quantify deviations from the standard mixing rules. For the rather size-symmetric salt solutions involving bromide and chloride ions, the standard mixing rules work fine. On the other hand, for the iodide and fluoride solutions, corresponding to the largest and smallest anion considered in this work, a rescaling of the mixing rules was necessary. For iodide, the experimental activities suggest more tightly bound ion pairing than given by the standard mixing rules, which is achieved in simulations by reducing the scaling factor of the cation-anion LJ energy. For fluoride, the situation is different and the simulations show too large attraction between fluoride and cations when compared with experimental data. For NaF, the situation can be rectified by increasing the cation-anion LJ energy. For KF, it proves necessary to increase the effective cation-anion Lennard-Jones diameter. The optimization strategy outlined in this work can be easily adapted to different kinds of ions.},

To resolve the fine differences between ions of the same valence and roughly similar size and in particular to correctly describe ion-specific effects, it is clear that accurate force fields are necessary. In the past, optimization strategies for ionic force fields either considered single-ion properties (such as the solvation free energy at infinite dilution or the ion-water structure) or ion-pair properties (in the form of ion-ion distribution functions). In this paper we investigate strategies to optimize ionic force fields based on single-ion and ion-pair properties simultaneously. To that end, we simulate five different salt solutions, namely, CsCl, KCl, NaI, KF, and CsI, at finite ion concentration. The force fields of these ions are systematically varied under the constraint that the single-ion solvation free energy matches the experimental value, which reduces the two-dimensional {σ,ε}{σ,ε} parameter space of the Lennard-Jones interaction to a one dimensional line for each ion. From the finite-concentration simulations, the pair potential is extracted and the osmotic coefficient is calculated, which is compared to experimental data. We find a strong dependence of the osmotic coefficient on the force field, which is remarkable as the single-ion solvation free energy and the ion-water structure remain invariant under the parameter variation. Optimization of the force field is achieved for the cations Cs+Cs+ and K+K+, while for the anions I−I− and F−F− the experimental osmotic coefficient cannot be reached. This suggests that in the long run, additional parameters might have to be introduced into the modeling, for example by modified mixing rules.},

A V-shaped anion series is observed in terms of the ion-specific interactions between the PMETAC brushes and the Hofmeister anions. We have found that the chaotropic and kosmotropic anions interact with the PMETAC brushes in different manners. The ion-specific interactions between the PMETAC brushes and the chaotropic anions are dominated by the direct interactions between the anions and the positively charged quaternary ammonium group via ion pairing mediated by ionic hydration strength or polarizability, whereas the ion-specific interactions between the PMETAC brushes and the kosmotropic anions are dominated by the competition for water molecules between the anions and the brushes. The ion-specific interactions between the PMETAC brushes and the anions have significant influences on both the hydration and the conformation of the brushes. The cations exhibit weaker specific ion effects on the PSPMA brushes in comparison with the specific anion effects on the PMETAC brushes.},

  abstract  = {Mg2+ ions are important in biological systems, particularly in stabilizing compact RNA folds. Mg2+ is strongly polarizing, and representing its interactions in heterogeneous environments is a challenge for empirical force field development. To date, the most commonly used force fields in molecular dynamics simulations utilize a pairwise-additive approximation for electrostatic interactions, which cannot account for the significant polarization response in systems containing Mg2+. In the present work, we refine the interactions of Mg2+ with water, Cl– ions, and nucleic acid moieties using a polarizable force field based on the classical Drude oscillator model. By targeting gas-phase quantum mechanical interaction energies and geometries of hydrated complexes, as well as condensed-phase osmotic pressure calculations, we present a model for Mg2+ that yields quantitative agreement with experimental measurements of water dissociation free energy and osmotic pressure across a broad range of concentrations. Notable is the direct modeling of steric repulsion between the water Drude oscillators and Mg2+ to treat the Pauli exclusion effects associated with overlap of the electron clouds of water molecules in the first hydration shell around Mg2+. Combined with the refined interactions with nucleic acid moieties, the present model represents a significant advancement in simulating nucleic acid systems containing Mg2+.},

The optimization process targeted gas-phase QM interaction energies of various model compounds with ions and osmotic pressures of bulk electrolyte solutions of chemically relevant ions. The optimized ionic parameters are validated against counterion condensation theory and buffer exchange–atomic emission spectroscopy measurements providing quantitative data on the competitive association of different monovalent ions with DNA. Comparison between experimental and MD simulation results demonstrates that, compared to the additive CHARMM36 model, the Drude FF provides an improved description of the general features of the ionic atmosphere around DNA and leads to closer agreement with experiment on the ionic competition within the ion atmosphere. Results indicate the importance of extended simulation systems on the order of 25 Å beyond the DNA surface to obtain proper convergence of ion distributions.},

Suwannee River humic acid (HA), fulvic acid (FA), and NOM flocculated from Ca2+ bearing solutions share similar morphological characteristics on the 100 nm to micron scales, including micron-sized equant fragments and rounded, rough areas with features on the 100 nm scale. HeIM suggests that the NOM floccs are built from a fundamental spheroidal structure that is ∼10 nm in diameter, in agreement with published AFM and small-angle X-ray scattering results. Calcium is incorporated into these floccs at 100% relative humidity in a wide range of disordered structural environments, with basic pH leading to shorter mean Ca–O distances and lower mean coordination numbers with respect to floccs formed under acidic conditions. The NMR results show that dynamical processes involving water and Ca2+ occurring at frequencies >104 Hz are important for hydrated OM floccs, in agreement with published molecular dynamics simulations of OM in solution. From the NMR results, we find evidence for two Ca2+ dynamic averaging mechanisms: one related to rapid exchange (>100 kHz) between surface proximity-restricted (those within 5 Å of a surface) and bulk solution environments when excess Ca2+ is present in the pore solution when pore water is unfrozen and a second consisting of intermediate scale (tens of kHz) site exchange among strongly sorbed inner-sphere sites when excess Ca2+ is absent and the carboxylic and phenolic functional groups of the NOM are deprotonated.},

A new version 3.2 multistate empirical valence bond (MS-EVB 3.2) model for the hydrated excess proton incorporating this presolvation behavior is therefore developed. The classical MS-EVB simulations show similar structural properties as those of the previous model but with significantly improved diffusive behavior. The inclusion of nuclear quantum effects in the MS-EVB also provides an even better description of the proton diffusion rate. To quantify the influence of anharmonicity, a second model (aMS-EVB 3.2) is developed using the anharmonic aSPC/Fw water model, which provides similar structural properties but improved spectroscopic responses at high frequencies.},

  abstract  = {Recently reported synthetic organic nanopore (SONP) can mimic a key feature of natural ion channels, i.e., selective ion transport. However, the physical mechanism underlying the K+/Na+ selectivity for the SONPs is dramatically different from that of natural ion channels. To achieve a better understanding of the selective ion transport in hydrophobic subnanometer channels in general and SONPs in particular, we perform a series of ab initio molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the diffusivity of aqua Na+ and K+ ions in two prototype hydrophobic nanochannels: (i) an SONP with radius of 3.2 Å, and (ii) single-walled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) with radii of 3–5 Å (these radii are comparable to those of the biological potassium K+ channels). We find that the hydration shell of aqua Na+ ion is smaller than that of aqua K+ ion but notably more structured and less yielding. The aqua ions do not lower the diffusivity of water molecules in CNTs, but in SONP the diffusivity of aqua ions (Na+ in particular) is strongly suppressed due to the rugged inner surface. Moreover, the aqua Na+ ion requires higher formation energy than aqua K+ ion in the hydrophobic nanochannels. As such, we find that the ion (K+ vs. Na+) selectivity of the (8, 8) CNT is ∼20× higher than that of SONP. Hence, the (8, 8) CNT is likely the most efficient artificial K+ channel due in part to its special interior environment in which Na+ can be fully solvated, whereas K+ cannot. This work provides deeper insights into the physical chemistry behind selective ion transport in nanochannels.},

We show that this simple physical model fails to describe the interaction of cations with (molecular) anions of weak carboxylic acids, which are present on the surfaces of many intra- and extracellular proteins. We performed molecular simulations with quantitatively accurate models and observed that the order K+ < Na+ < Li+ of increasing binding affinity with carboxylate ions is caused by a stronger preference for forming weak solvent-shared ion pairs. The relative insignificance of contact pair interactions with protein surfaces indicates that thermodynamic stability and interactions between proteins in alkali salt solutions is governed by interactions mediated through hydration water molecules.},

We use molecular simulations to show that the effective forces between small ions change character dramatically near the water vapor–liquid interface. Specifically, the water-mediated attraction between oppositely charged ions is enhanced relative to that in bulk water. Further, the repulsion between like-charged ions is weaker than that expected from a continuum dielectric description and can even become attractive as the ions are drawn to the vapor side. We show that thermodynamics of ion association are governed by a delicate balance of ion hydration, interfacial tension, and restriction of capillary fluctuations at the interface, leading to nonintuitive phenomena, such as water-mediated like charge attraction. “Sticky” electrostatic interactions may have important consequences on biomolecular structure, assembly, and aggregation at soft liquid interfaces. We demonstrate this by studying an interfacially active model peptide that changes its structure from α-helical to a hairpin-turn–like one in response to charging of its ends.},

  abstract  = {Ionic liquids (ILs) are liquids consisting entirely of ions and can be further defined as molten salts having melting points lower than 100 °C. One of the most important research areas for IL utilization is undoubtedly their energy application, especially for energy storage and conversion materials and devices, because there is a continuously increasing demand for clean and sustainable energy. In this article, various application of ILs are reviewed by focusing on their use as electrolyte materials for Li/Na ion batteries, Li-sulfur batteries, Li-oxygen batteries, and nonhumidified fuel cells and as carbon precursors for electrode catalysts of fuel cells and electrode materials for batteries and supercapacitors. Due to their characteristic properties such as nonvolatility, high thermal stability, and high ionic conductivity, ILs appear to meet the rigorous demands/criteria of these various applications. However, for further development, specific applications for which these characteristic properties become unique (i.e., not easily achieved by other materials) must be explored. Thus, through strong demands for research and consideration of ILs unique properties, we will be able to identify indispensable applications for ILs.},

  abstract  = {In this study, the structural characteristics of high-coordinated Ca–Cl complexes present in mixed CaCl2–LiCl aqueous solution were investigated using density functional theory (DFT) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The DFT results show that [CaClx]2–x (x = 4–6) clusters are quite unstable in the gas phase, but these clusters become metastable when hydration is considered. The MD simulations show that high-coordinated Ca–chloro complexes are possible transient species that exist for up to nanoseconds in concentrated (11.10 mol·kg–1) Cl– solution at 273 and 298 K. As the temperature increases to 423 K, these high-coordinated structures tend to disassociate and convert into smaller clusters and single free ions. The presence of high-order Ca–Cl species in concentrated LiCl solution can be attributed to their enhanced hydration shell and the inadequate hydration of ions. The probability of the [CaClx]2–xaq (x = 4–6) species being present in concentrated LiCl solution decreases greatly with increasing temperature, which also indicates that the formation of the high-coordinated Ca–Cl structure is related to its hydration characteristics.},

These are known as solvate ionic liquids (SILs). Glyme-based SILs have thermal and electrochemical properties favorable for use as lithium-conducting electrolytes in lithium batteries. However, their intrinsically high viscosities and low ionic conductivities prevent practical application. Therefore, we diluted SILs with molecular solvents in order to enhance their ionic conductivities. To determine the stabilities of the complex cations in diluted SILs, their conductivity and viscosity, the self-diffusion coefficients, and Raman spectra were measured. [Li(G3)]+ and [Li(G4)]+ were stable in nonpolar solvents, that is, toluene, diethyl carbonate, and a hydrofluoroether (HFE); however, ligand exchange took place between glyme and solvent when polar solvents, that is, water and propylene carbonate, were used. In acetonitrile (AN) mixed solvent complex cations [Li(G3)(AN)]+ and [Li(G4)(AN)]+ were formed. [Li(G4)][TFSA] was more conductive than [Li(G3)][TFSA] when diluted with nonpolar solvents due to the greater ionic dissociativity in [Li(G4)][TFSA] mixtures. In view of the stability of the Li–glyme complex cations, the enhanced ionic conductivities, and the intrinsic electrochemical stabilities of the diluting solvents, [Li(G4)][TFSA] diluted by toluene or HFE, can be a candidate for an alternative battery electrolyte.},

  abstract  = {Picosecond pulse radiolysis measurements have been performed in several highly concentrated HClO4 and H3PO4 aqueous solutions containing silver ions at different concentrations. Silver ion reduction is used to unravel the ultrafast reduction reactions observed at the end of a 7 ps electron pulse. Solvated electrons and silver atoms are observed by the pulse (electron beam)–probe (supercontinuum light) method. In highly acidic solutions, ultrafast reduction of silver ions is observed, a finding that is not compatible with a reaction between the H• atom and silver ions, which is known to be thermally activated. In addition, silver ion reduction is found to be even more efficient in phosphoric acid solution than that in neutral solution. In the acidic solutions investigated here, the species responsible for the reduction of silver atoms is considered to be the precursor of the H• atom. This precursor, denoted (e–, H3O+), is a pair constituting an electron (not fully solvated) and H3O+. Its structure differs from that of the pair of a solvated electron and a hydronium ion (es–, H3O+), which absorbs in the visible region. The (e–, H3O+) pair , called the pre-H• atom here, undergoes ultrafast electron transfer and can, like the presolvated electron, reduce silver ions much faster than the H• atom. Moreover, it is found that with the same concentration of H3O+ the reduction reaction is favored in the phosphoric acid solution compared to that in the perchloric acid solution because of the less-efficient electron solvation process. The kinetics show that among the three reducing species, (e–, H3O+), (es–, H3O+), and H• atom, the first one is the most efficient.},

SSZ-13 zeolites (Si/Al = 15–30) that crystallized in hydroxide media and in the presence of only N,N,N-trimethyl-1-admantylammonium cations (TMAda+) contained only isolated framework Al, evident in their inability to exchange divalent Cu2+ or Co2+ cations that titrate paired Al sites. Addition of Na+ to the zeolite crystallization medium, with total cationic charge ((Na+ + TMAda+)/Al) and other synthesis parameters held constant, crystallized SSZ-13 zeolites at a fixed Si/Al ratio but with paired Al densities that increased linearly with the Na+ content incorporated into the crystalline solids. Crystallization media containing equimolar amounts of Na+ and TMAda+, but varying Al content, crystallized SSZ-13 at different compositions (Si/Al = 5, 15, 25) with the paired Al density expected if Al atoms were distributed randomly subject to Löwenstein’s rule. The relative ratio of organic (TMAda+) and inorganic (Na+) cations in the crystallization medium, which determines its cationic charge density, systematically influences the arrangement of isolated and paired Al, which determines the anionic charge density in the zeolite framework. The synthetic strategy of using mixtures of organic and inorganic structure-directing agents extends concepts of charge density mismatch in zeolite crystallization, which have been exploited previously to discover routes to new framework topologies and compositions, to systematically control the atomic arrangement in a given zeolite at fixed composition and, in doing so, provide new methods to introduce structural and catalytic diversity.},

  abstract  = {Amorphous hydrated complexes of the polyelectrolytes poly(styrene sulfonate) (PSS) and poly(diallyldimethylammonium) were doped with the spin-5/2 ion Mn2+. X-band electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) measurements of the Mn2+ spins within these stoichiometric polyelectrolyte complexes (PECs) revealed an octahedral coordination environment, similar to that observed in aqueous solutions of Mn2+. This octahedral symmetry of the [Mn(H2O)6]2+ complexes, observed in fully hydrated PECs, is somewhat distorted because of the wide range of ion pairs possible with the sulfonate group on PSS. As the Mn2+ concentration was increased, the linewidths broadened, indicating the dominance of dipolar broadening over exchange narrowing in determining the linewidths; that is, any exchange narrowing was masked by the large dipolar broadening. The calculated linewidths were used to estimate the strengths of the dipolar interactions, and hence the distances between the Mn2+ spins, on the basis of a simple model of regularly spaced spins. The distances calculated by this method were roughly comparable to the geometric average distances calculated on the basis of the Mn2+ concentrations and densities of the doped PEC samples. From a comparison of their EPR spectra, the ion environments in the doped, fully hydrated PECs were found to be similar to those in hydrated classical ion exchange resins. EPR spectra before and after drying of the PECs indicate the replacement of octahedrally coordinated water by oxide anions from the polyanion chain and the corresponding loss of the symmetric environment of Mn2+ ions.},

  abstract  = {Driving forces for association between oppositely charged biological or synthetic polymers in aqueous solution have long been identified as electrostatic in origin. This attraction is broken down into an entropic component, due to loss of counterions, and an enthalpic component, stemming from Coulombic attraction between opposite charges. While the balance between entropic and enthalpic contributions shifts according to the conditions, the presence of exotherms or endotherms on mixing, though small, are viewed as signatures of Coulombic interactions which support theories of polyelectrolyte association rooted in continuum electrostatics. Here, a head-to-head comparison is made between mechanisms based on electrostatics and those based on specific ion pairing, or ion exchange. Using a Hofmeister series of counterions for a common polycation, poly(diallyldimethylammonium), enthalpy changes on association with poly(styrenesulfonate) are shown to derive from changes in water perturbation, revealed by Raman scattering studies of water O–H vibrations. The free energy for complexation is almost completely entropic over all salt concentrations.},

For a series of different solvents, the interaction between substrate and catalyst is dominated by ion-pairing, rather than hydrogen bonding, at ambient conditions.

  abstract  = {In this combined computational and experimental study, specific chemical interactions affecting the prediction of one-electron and two-electron reduction potentials for anthraquinone derivatives are investigated. For 19 redox reactions in acidic aqueous solution, where AQ is reduced to hydroanthraquinone, density functional theory (DFT) with the polarizable continuum model (PCM) gives a mean absolute deviation (MAD) of 0.037 V for 16 species. DFT(PCM), however, highly overestimates three redox couples with a MAD of 0.194 V, which is almost 5 times that of the remaining 16. These three molecules have ether groups positioned for intramolecular hydrogen bonding that are not balanced with the intermolecular H-bonding of the solvent. This imbalanced description is corrected by quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) simulations, which include explicit water molecules. The best theoretical estimations result in a good correlation with experiments, V(Theory) = 0.903V(Expt) + 0.007 with an R2 value of 0.835 and an MAD of 0.033 V. In addition to the aqueous test set, 221 anthraquinone redox couples in aprotic solvent were studied. Five anthraquinone derivatives spanning a range of redox potentials were selected from this library, and their reduction potentials were measured by cyclic voltammetry. DFT(PCM) calculations predict the first reduction potential with high accuracy giving the linear relation, V(Theory) = 0.960V(Expt) – 0.049 with an R2 value of 0.937 and an MAD of 0.051 V. This approach, however, significantly underestimates the second reduction potential, with an MAD of 0.329 V. It is shown herein that treatment of explicit ion-pair interactions between the anthraquinone derivatives and the cation of the supporting electrolyte is required for the accurate prediction of the second reduction potential. After the correction, V(Theory) = 1.045V(Expt) – 0.088 with an R2 value 0.910 and an MAD value reduced by more than half to 0.145 V. Finally, molecular design principles are discussed that go beyond simple electron-donating and electron-withdrawing effects to lead to predictable and controllable reduction potentials.},

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy studies show that a conversion mechanism takes place during cycling in a nonaqueous electrolyte, with the formation of MnOOH, MnO, and Mg(OH)2 upon discharge. In aqueous cells, on the other hand, intercalation of Mg2+ ions takes place, accompanied by expulsion of interlayer water and transformation to a spinel-like phase as evidenced by X-ray diffraction. Both systems are structurally quasireversible. The sharp contrast in behavior in the two electrolytes points to the important role of the desolvation energy of the Mg2+ cation in nonaqueous systems.},

In this context, the determination of their phase diagrams and the physical properties of the coexisting phases are of high relevance when envisaging their large-scale applications. Low viscosities improve mass transfer and reduce energy consumption, while the knowledge of their densities is important for equipment design. In this work, novel phase diagrams for aqueous solutions of imidazolium-based ILs combined with acetate-based salts, namely KCH3CO2 or NaCH3CO2, are reported and discussed. The ability of the acetate-based salts to induce the phase separation not only depends on the ions hydration energy, but also on the concentration of “free” ions in solution. The tie-lines, tie-line lengths, and critical points are also addressed. Experimental measurements of density and viscosity of the coexisting phases, for the different systems and at several compositions and temperatures, are additionally presented. The Othmer–Tobias and Bancroft equations are also applied to ascertain the tie-lines coherence. It is here shown that low-viscous IL-based ABS, with a high difference in the densities of the coexisting phases, can be formed with organic and biodegradable salts thus offering enhanced features over conventional polymer-based systems.},

  abstract  = {Saline aqueous solutions at elevated pressures and temperatures play an important role in processes such as supercritical water oxidation (SCWO) and supercritical water gasification (SCWG), as well as in natural geochemical processes in Earth and planetary interiors. Some solutions exhibit a negative temperature coefficient of solubility at high temperatures, thereby leading to salt precipitation with increasing temperature. Using modulated FT-IR Raman spectroscopy and classical molecular dynamics simulations (MD), we studied the solute speciation in solutions of 10 wt % Na2SO4, at conditions close to the saturation limit. Our experiments reveal that ion pairing and cluster formation are favored as solid saturation is approached, and ionic clusters form prior to the precipitation of solid sulfate. The proportion of such clusters increases as the phase boundary is approached either by decreasing pressure or by increasing temperature in the vicinity of the three-phase (vapor–liquid–solid) curve.},

The solubility of barium sulfate in pure water was then predicted a priori from 273.15 to 598.15 K and pressures up to 140 MPa, and the results were compared with the literature data. These predicted solubility values for barium sulfate in pure water, when corrected for ion pair association of Ba2+(aq) ion with SO42–(aq) ion and hydrolysis of SO42–(aq) ion, are in very good agreement with the literature data to well within the uncertainties of the experimental data at all temperatures and pressures considered. Using the experimental data from this study and auxiliary data from the literature, the logarithm of the molar dissociation constants of BaSO4° associated ion pair were also calculated up to 598.15 K and up to 150 MPa.},

  abstract  = {An improved and simplified version of the finite temperature string (FTS) method [W. E, W. Ren, and E. Vanden-Eijnden, J. Phys. Chem. B 109, 6688 (2005)] is proposed. Like the original approach, the new method is a scheme to calculate the principal curves associated with the Boltzmann–Gibbs probability distribution of the system, i.e., the curves which are such that their intersection with the hyperplanes perpendicular to themselves coincides with the expected position of the system in these planes (where perpendicular is understood with respect to the appropriate metric). Unlike more standard paths such as the minimum energy path or the minimum free energy path, the location of the principal curve depends on global features of the energy or the free energy landscapes and thereby may remain appropriate in situations where the landscape is rough on the thermal energy scale and/or entropic effects related to the width of the reaction channels matter. Instead of using constrained sampling in hyperplanes as in the original FTS, the new method calculates the principal curve via sampling in the Voronoi tessellation whose generating points are the discretization points along this curve. As shown here, this modification results in greater algorithmic simplicity. As a by-product, it also gives the free energy associated with the Voronoi tessellation. The new method can be applied both in the original Cartesian space of the system or in a set of collective variables. We illustrate FTS on test-case examples and apply it to the study of conformational transitions of the nitrogen regulatory protein C receiver domain using an elastic network model and to the isomerization of solvated alanine dipeptide},

  abstract  = {Superoxide reductase is a mononuclear iron enzyme involved in superoxide radical detoxification in some bacteria. Its catalytic mechanism is associated with the remarkable formation of a ferric hydroperoxide Fe3+-OOH intermediate, which is specifically protonated on its proximal oxygen to generate the reaction product H2O2. Here, we present a computational study of the protonation mechanism of the Fe3+-OOH intermediate, at different levels of theory. This was performed on the whole system (solvated protein) using well-tempered metadynamics at the QM/MM (B3LYP/AmberFF99SB) level. Enabled by the development of a new set of force field parameters for the active site, a conformational MM study of the Fe3+-OOH species gave insights into its solvation pattern, in addition to generating the two starting conformations for the ab initio metadynamics setup. Two different protonation mechanisms for the Fe3+-OOH intermediate have been found depending on the starting structure. Whereas a possible mechanism involves at first the protonation of the hydroperoxide ligand and then dissociation of H2O2, the most probable one starts with an unexpected dissociation of the HOO– ligand from the iron, followed by its protonation. This favored reactivity was specifically linked to the influence of both the nearby conserved lysine 48 residue and the microsolvatation on the charge distribution of the oxygens of the HOO– ligand. These data highlight the crucial role of the whole environment, solvent, and protein, to describe accurately this second protonation step in superoxide reductase. This is clearly not possible with smaller models unable to reproduce correctly the mechanistically determinant charge distribution.},

In addition to hydrated individual ions and ion pairs identified previously, hydrated ion clusters containing 3, 4, 5, or more ions are identified in the present paper. The dependence of hydration numbers and mole fractions of individual ions, ion pairs, and larger ion clusters on the electrolyte concentration is determined. As the electrolyte concentration increases, the mole fraction of hydrated individual ions decreases, and the mole fraction of hydrated larger ion clusters increases. The results also reveal that the hydrogen bonding numbers of the H2O molecules of the first hydration shells of individual ions, ion pairs, and larger ion clusters are insensitive to the electrolyte concentration, but sensitive to the nature and conformation of ions.},

Using Markov state models, we estimated the average time needed for the system to make a transition from discorded state to a state with big ionic cluster. Our results suggest that the characteristic time to form an ionic cluster is a negative exponential function of the salt concentration. Moreover, we defined and analyzed three different kinetic states of a single ion particle. These states correspond to a different particle location during nucleation process.},

  abstract  = {Significant effort has been undertaken to better understand the molecular details governing the propensity of ions for the air–water interface. Facilitated by computationally efficient reactive molecular dynamics simulations, new and statistically conclusive molecular-scale results on the affinity of the hydrated excess proton and hydroxide anion for the air–water interface are presented. These simulations capture the dynamic bond breaking and formation processes (charge defect delocalization) that are important for correctly describing the solvation and transport of these complex species. The excess proton is found to be attracted to the interface, which is correlated with a favorable enthalpic contribution and consistent with reducing the disruption in the hydrogen bond network caused by the ion complex. However, a recent refinement of the underlying reactive potential energy function for the hydrated excess proton shows the interfacial attraction to be weaker, albeit nonzero, a result that is consistent with the experimental surface tension measurements. The influence of a weak hydrogen bond donated from water to the protonated oxygen, recently found to play an important role in excess hydrated proton transport in bulk water, is seen to also be important for this study. In contrast, the hydroxide ion is found to be repelled from the air–water interface. This repulsion is characterized by a reduction of the energetically favorable ion–water interactions, which creates an enthalpic penalty as the ion approaches the interface. Finally, we find that the fluctuation in the coordination number around water sheds new light on the observed entropic trends for both ions.},

Here, we carry out QM calculations with an explicit description of water on the Cu(100) surface (experimentally shown to be stable under CO2 reduction reaction conditions) to examine the initial reaction pathways to form CO and formate (HCOO–) from CO2 through free energy calculations at 298 K and pH 7. We find that CO formation proceeds from physisorbed CO2 to chemisorbed CO2 (*CO2δ−), with a free energy barrier of ΔG⧧ = 0.43 eV, the rate-determining step (RDS). The subsequent barriers of protonating *CO2δ− to form COOH* and then dissociating COOH* to form *CO are 0.37 and 0.30 eV, respectively. HCOO– formation proceeds through a very different pathway in which physisorbed CO2 reacts directly with a surface H* (along with electron transfer), leading to ΔG⧧ = 0.80 eV. Thus, the competition between CO formation and HCOO– formation occurs in the first electron-transfer step. On Cu(100), the RDS for CO formation is lower, making CO the predominant product. Thus, to alter the product distribution, we need to control this first step of CO2 binding, which might involve controlling pH, alloying, or changing the structure at the nanoscale.},

  abstract  = {We present results of ab initio electronic structure and molecular dynamics simulations (AIMD), as well as a microkinetic model of CO oxidation catalyzed by TiO2 supported Au nanocatalysts. A coverage-dependent microkinetic analysis, based on energetics obtained with density functional methods, shows that the dominant kinetic pathway, activated oxygen species, and catalytic active sites are all strongly depended on both temperature and oxygen partial pressure. Under oxidizing conditions and T < 400 K, the prevalent pathway involves a dynamic single atom catalytic mechanism. This reaction is catalyzed by a transient Au—CO species that migrates from the Au-cluster onto a surface oxygen adatom. It subsequently reacts with the TiO2 support via a Mars van Krevelen mechanism to form CO2 and finally the Au atom reintegrates back into the gold cluster to complete the catalytic cycle. At 300 ≤ T ≤ 600 K, oxygen-bound single Oad—Au+—CO sites and the perimeter Au-sites of the nanoparticle work in tandem to optimally catalyze the reaction. Above 600 K, a variety of alternate pathways associated with both single-atom and the perimeter sites of the Au nanoparticle are found to be active. Under low oxygen pressures, Oad—Au+—CO species can be a source of catalyst deactivation and the dominant pathway involves only Au-perimeter sites. A detailed comparison of the current model and the existing literature resolves many apparent inconsistencies in the mechanistic interpretations.},

Here, we report results from high-level electronic structure calculations as well as both classical and Born–Oppenheimer ab initio molecular dynamics simulations of glyoxal solvation at the air/liquid water interface. When compared to the gas phase, the trans to cis isomerization of glyoxal at the liquid water interface is found to be catalyzed; additionally, the trans conformation is selectively solvated within the bulk to a greater degree than is the cis conformation. These two processes, i.e., the catalytic effect at the water interface and the differentially selective solvation, act to enhance the concentration of the cis isomer of glyoxal at the water interface. This has important consequences for the interpretation of experiments and for the modeling of glyoxal chemistry both at the interface of water clouds and at aerosols. Broader implications of this work relate to describing the role of interfaces in selecting specific stereo molecular structures at interfacial environments.},

The three phosphate anions were found to be extensively hydrated, with total hydration numbers at infinite dilution of ∼11 (for H2PO4–), ∼20 (HPO42–), and ∼39 (PO43–). These values are indicative of the existence of a second hydration shell around HPO42– and especially PO43–. Two types of hydrating water molecules could be quantified: irrotationally bound (ib, H2O molecules essentially “frozen” on the DRS time scale) and “slow” (loosely bound water molecules with identifiably slower dynamics than bulk water). For H2PO4– over the entire concentration range and for HPO42– and PO43– at concentrations c ≲ 1 mol L–1, only “slow” H2O was detected; however, at higher concentrations of the latter two anions, an increasing fraction of ib water appears, making up ∼50% of the total hydration number close to the saturation limit of K2HPO4. Contrary to common belief, all three salts showed significant ion pair formation, with standard association constants of the 1:1 species increasing in the order: KH2PO40(aq) < KHPO4–(aq) < KPO42–(aq). The main type of ion pair in solution shifted from solvent-shared ion pairs (SIPs) to double-solvent-separated ion pairs (2SIPs) in the same sequence.},

Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and thermodynamic integration provided details of the ion pairing of protein surface residues with alkali-metal cations. Our results at pH 6.2 indicate that BLG at the air–water interface forms mono- and bilayers preferably at low and high ionic strength, respectively. Results from SFG spectroscopy and ellipsometry are consistent with intimate ion pairing of alkali-metal cations with aspartate and glutamate carboxylates, which is shown to be more effective for smaller cations (Li+ and Na+). MD simulations show not only carboxylate–alkali-metal ion pairs but also ion multiplets with the alkali-metal ion in a bridging position between two or more carboxylates. Consequently, alkali-metal cations can bridge carboxylates not only within a monomer but also between monomers, thus providing an important dimerization mechanism between hydrophilic surface patches.},

This article shows how amphiphilicity may be added to sub-2-nm metal NCs by patching hydrophilic NCs (e.g., Au25(MHA)18 NCs where MHA is 6-mercaptohexanoic acid) with hydrophobic cations (e.g., cetyltrimethylammonium ion, CTA+) to about half of a monolayer coverage. Specifically we demonstrate the preparation of amphiphilic Au25(MHA)18@xCTA NCs (x = 6–9 where x is the number of CTA+ per NC) by the phase-transfer (PT) driven ion-paring reaction between CTA+ and −COO– (derived from the deprotonation of the terminal carboxyl group of MHA). Due to the coexistence of flexible hydrophilic MHA and hydrophobic MHA···CTA ligands in comparable amounts on the NC surface, the Au25(MHA)18@xCTA NCs (x = 6–9) exhibit good amphiphilicity, which enabled them to dissolve in solvents with distinctly different polarities and to self-assemble like a molecular amphiphile. Consequently, the amphiphilic Au25(MHA)18@xCTA NCs (x = 6–9) could self-organize into stacked bilayers at the air–liquid interface, similar to the formation of lyotropic liquid crystalline phases by common surfactants. The good solubility and molecular-amphiphile-like self-assembly properties can significantly increase the utility of noble metal NCs in basic and applied research.},

  abstract  = {The coexistence of several types of ion pairs in solution together with their elusive nature hampers their experimental characterization, which relies in practice on theoretical models resorting to numerous approximations. In this context, a series of isolated contact ion pairs between a lithium cation and phenyl-tagged carboxylate anions of various lengths (Ph-(CH2)n-COO–, n = 1–3) has been investigated in a conformer-selective manner by IR and UV laser spectroscopy, in conjunction with quantum chemistry calculations. The typical gas-phase IR signature of the bidentate structure formed between the carboxylate moiety and Li+ has thus been obtained in the CO2– stretch region. In addition to the cation–anion interaction, a cation−π interaction occurs simultaneously in the largest system investigated (n = 3). The resulting distorted ion pair structure has been evidenced from both the IR signature of the CO2– stretches and the unique vibrationally resolved UV spectroscopy of a phenyl ring interacting with a cation. Such specific spectroscopic signatures of contact ion pairs provide experimental benchmarks, alternative to theoretical predictions, that can assist the assignment of vibrational spectra in solution.},

  abstract  = {Ion pairing can have profound effects upon the ionic strength of electrolyte solutions but is poorly understood in solutions containing more than one solvent. Herein a combined density functional theory and molecular dynamics approach is used to examine the effect of both methanol concentration and interionic distance upon the structure and dynamics within successive solvation shells of Na+ and Cl– in water/methanol binary solutions. The structure and dynamics of the first and second solvation shells were studied along a reaction coordinate associated with ion pair formation using potential of mean force simulations. The lifetimes of the solvent–solvent hydrogen bonds become perturbed when the second solvation shells of the ions begin to interact. In contrast, the structural properties within the first and second solvation shells of the ions were found to be largely independent of both methanol concentration and interionic distance until a contact ion pair is formed. Thus, as the ions are brought together, the effect of the opposing ion manifests itself in the solvation dynamics before any structural changes are observed. As anticipated based upon the decreased dielectric constant of the binary solution, ion pair formation becomes energetically more favorable as the concentration of methanol increases.},

Despite their importance in many chemical reactive phenomena, how ion–ion interactions are affected by interfaces and their influence on kinetic processes is not well understood. We carried out molecular simulations to examine the thermodynamics and kinetics of small alkali halide ions in the bulk and near the water liquid–vapor interface. We calculated dissociation rates using classical transition-state theory and corrected them with transmission coefficients determined by the reactive flux method and Grote–Hynes theory. Our results show that in addition to affecting the free energy of ions in solution, the interfacial environments significantly influence the kinetics of ion pairing. Results on the relaxation time obtained using the reactive flux method and Grote–Hynes theory present an unequivocal picture that the interface suppresses ion dissociation.},

The asymmetric stretching absorption band from 1250 to 1450 cm–1 changes line shape with temperature, allowing two distinct peaks to be fit for each spectrum. Because each peak is assigned based on electronic structure calculations as a proxy to a different solvation motif, van’t Hoff plots provide insight into the thermodynamics of exchange between different solvation geometries. A strong linear trend is seen between increased ionic strength and the magnitude of both the enthalpic and entropic contributions to the solvation geometry stabilities. Electronic structure computations of previously proposed structures in different ionic strengths are performed in the presence of external fields, roughly simulating the impact of ions in solution.},

However, experimental observations of ion pairing at the ligand/solid interfaces are challenging due to difficulties in differentiating ion species in the electrical double layer from that adsorbed on the solid surfaces. Using surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy in combination with electrolyte washing, we presented herein the first direct experimental evidence of ion pairing, the coadsorption of oppositely charged ionic species onto gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). Ion pairing reduces the electrolyte concentration threshold in inducing AuNP aggregation and enhances the competitiveness of electrolyte over neutral molecules for binding to AuNP surfaces. The methodology and insights provided in this work should be important for understanding electrolyte interfacial interactions with nanoparticles.},

It is shown that propene can be formed from monomeric and dimeric adsorbed 1-propanol. The stronger adsorption of 1-propanol relative to water indicates that the reduced dehydration rates in the presence of water are not a consequence of the competitive adsorption between 1-propanol and water. Instead, the deleterious effect is related to the different extents of stabilization of adsorbed intermediates and the relevant elimination/substitution transition states by water. Water stabilizes the adsorbed 1-propanol monomer significantly more than the elimination transition state, leading to a higher activation barrier and a greater entropy gain for the rate-limiting step, which eventually leads to propene. In a similar manner, an excess of 1-propanol stabilizes the adsorbed state of 1-propanol more than the elimination transition state. In comparison with the monomer-mediated pathway, adsorbed dimer and the relevant transition states for propene and ether formation are similarly, while less effectively, stabilized by intrazeolite water molecules.},

  abstract  = {The photodissociation of small molecules occurs upon irradiation by ultraviolet or visible light, and it is a very important chemical process in Earth’s atmosphere, in the atmospheres of other planets, and in interstellar media. Photodissociation is an important method used to thoroughly investigate the fundamental issues of chemical reactivity. Photodissociation involves molecules and reaction fragments moving over ground- and excited-state potential surfaces (PESs). Molecules can move on a single PES (adiabatic pathway) or can cross over from one PES to another (nonadiabatic pathways). For a full theoretical understanding of a photodissociation mechanism, all of the important nonadiabatic and adiabatic pathways must be determined. This is not an easy task. We have developed an efficient computational method, called the global reaction route mapping (GRRM) strategy, that allows a theoretical exploration of ground- and excited-state PESs and their crossing seams in an automatic manner. In this Perspective, we summarize our approaches and present examples of their application together with newly determined chemical insights. These include the complex photodissociation mechanism of the formaldehyde molecule, the exclusive excited-state roaming dynamics of the nitrate radical, and all product channels and conformational memory in the photodissociation of the formic acid molecule. Finally, perspectives for the theoretical design of photofunctional molecules are discussed.},

  abstract  = { ▪ Abstract This review provides a historical context for our understanding of the hydration shell surrounding halide ions and illustrates how the cluster systems can be used, in combination with theory, to elucidate the behavior of water molecules in direct contact with the anion. We discuss how vibrational predissociation spectroscopy, carried out with weakly bound argon atoms, has been employed to deduce the morphology of the small water networks attached to anions in the primary steps of hydration. We emphasize the importance of charge-transfer in the binary interaction, and discuss how this process affects the structures of the larger networks. Finally, we survey how the negatively charged water clusters (H2O)n− are providing a molecular-level perspective on how diffuse excess electrons interact with the water networks. },

  abstract  = { The nature of acids in an aqueous environment is fundamental to many aspects of chemistry. The defining feature of an acid is its ability to transfer a proton to water, but this seemingly simple process can be complex and highly dependent on solvation. This review describes studies aimed at obtaining molecular-level descriptions of acid-water interactions through the study of neutral acid-water complexes. Current understanding of the nature of hydrated protons is first summarized, and a parallel discussion of structural aspects of acid-water complexes is then presented. The nature of proton transfer, and its evolution with cluster size, is described. The review concludes with several examples that lie at the intersection between fundamental work on hydrated acids and important physiochemical processes in the atmosphere. },

  abstract  = {Accurate mechanistic description of structural changes in biomolecules is an increasingly important topic in structural and chemical biology. Markov models have emerged as a powerful way to approximate the molecular kinetics of large biomolecules while keeping full structural resolution in a divide-and-conquer fashion. However, the accuracy of these models is limited by that of the force fields used to generate the underlying molecular dynamics (MD) simulation data. Whereas the quality of classical MD force fields has improved significantly in recent years, remaining errors in the Boltzmann weights are still on the order of a few kT, which may lead to significant discrepancies when comparing to experimentally measured rates or state populations. Here we take the view that simulations using a sufficiently good force-field sample conformations that are valid but have inaccurate weights, yet these weights may be made accurate by incorporating experimental data a posteriori. To do so, we propose augmented Markov models (AMMs), an approach that combines concepts from probability theory and information theory to consistently treat systematic force-field error and statistical errors in simulation and experiment. Our results demonstrate that AMMs can reconcile conflicting results for protein mechanisms obtained by different force fields and correct for a wide range of stationary and dynamical observables even when only equilibrium measurements are incorporated into the estimation process. This approach constitutes a unique avenue to combine experiment and computation into integrative models of biomolecular structure and dynamics.},

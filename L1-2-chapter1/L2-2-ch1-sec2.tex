\section{Prior Investigations to this Problem}

\begin{spacing}{2.0}

    To study this chemical process, one can observe some variables that relate to the interionic separation or the ion - solvent association.
    Experimental techniques such as NMR, IR, or EXAFS [CITE] have been used to probe the equilibrium structures, while simulations have
    been used to provide equilibrium statistics. \textbf{[TALK BRIEFLY ABOUT HOW STUDYING FREE ENERGY HELPS]}

    This dissertation presents our research which aim to address the problems highlighted in \ref{sec:L12L23}, and contains 6 chapters including this 
    chapter. Chapter 2 is dedicated to discussing the theories of MSM and the projection of MSM eigenfunctions onto the collective variable spaces 
    using tICA and subsequent dimensional reduction through matching pursuit (MP). Chapter 3 presents our application of MSM to the classical MD 
    simulations of LiCl and NaCl in aqueous solutions and our discussions on the significance of the results in terms of the plausible SSIP - CIP 
    transition mechanism based on the reaction coordinates found using MSM and the dynamics of the bulk. Chapter 4 discusses the theories of free 
    energy computation and the best way to overcome the dimensionality problem using a combination of fast exploration through WT-MTD simulations 
    and a machine learning-based reconstruction of free energy with GPR to ensure a smooth reconstruction of the free energy surfaces in any numbers 
    of dimensions. Chapter 5 features the applications of GPR to compute the two-dimensional free energy landscapes of LiCl and NaCl in the $r_{+-}$ 
    and $n_{+}$ coordinates, which is the first application of a two-dimensional GPR calculation beyond the peptide rotation models, and chapter 6 
    highlights the present challenges and possible future directions of this kind of research,

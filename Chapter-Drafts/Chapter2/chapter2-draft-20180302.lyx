Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Although intuitions allow us to describe a reaction coordinate that suits
 the narratives of the researchers' perceptions, the main problem in determining
 the contributing collective variables for a reaction coordinate from pure
 intuition is there are no systematic ways to confirm the researchers' beliefs.
 The fact that 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{+}$
\end_inset

 was used as a collective variable in the solvent coordinate demonstrates
 the intuition-based choice that are relatively accepted in many recent
 literatures.
 For example, the recent work of Raiteri et al.
 uses this fact to construct two-dimensional free energy landscapes with
 interionic separation (
\begin_inset Formula $r_{+-}$
\end_inset

) and 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{+}$
\end_inset

 as collective variables of the alkali earth ions pairing interactions with
 carbonate ions in aqueous solution to validate their empirical potential
 model for these ions.
 [CITE] Roy et al.
 also recently published a two-dimensional free energy calculation using
 the same set of C.V.'s for alkali ions.
 [CITE] However, the work of Mullen et al.
 challenged this belief by claiming that 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{+}$
\end_inset

 does not play a significant role in the process at all.
 On the other hand, the solvent coordinate that plays an important role
 for this process are 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{B}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{ii}$
\end_inset

 coordinates mentioned in [REF 1.2].
 [CITE]
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The significance of the work of Mullen et al.
 was that it was the first work that performed a systematic analysis of
 multiple collective variables to determine the best contribution of the
 collective variables according to the reaction coordinate.
 However, we have mentioned in [REF 1.3] that there are some possible issues
 that arose from their results, mainly his crude restriction of the reaction
 coordinate that should only consisft of a linear combination of 3 collective
 variables, while there are possibly more collective variables than 3 that
 could actually involve in the process.
 Moreover, their work mainly focused on the SSIP - CIP transition without
 thoroughly covering the behavior of the bulk region.
 Therefore, the association pattern from the bulk still remained relatively
 little understood.
 Also, the efficiency of the method outlined in Mullen et al.
 also rely a lot on the fact that we could accurately find two isocommittor
 surfaces and the events that the simulation trajectory crosses between
 these two, which could be cumbersome in the case where systems do not have
 a well-defined barrier or the system with multiple metastable states that
 are close to one another with relatively low barrier.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As mentioned in Rohrdanz et al., there are many possible methods that can
 be used to tackle this problem.
 [P-AnnuRevPhysChem-2013-v64-Rohrdanz] Out of the methods highlighted in
 Rohrdanz et al., the Markov State Model (MSM) is a viable candidate yet
 it is still not being applied to this type of problem.
 In our opinion, the fact that any MD simulations that is ergodic are shown
 to exhibit Markovian properties [CITE] implies that we could express the
 dynamics of any MD simulations in terms of their chatacteristic eigenfunctions
 and eigenvalues corresponding to specific transitions between metastable
 states [CITE MSM].
 Therefore, MSM allows a characterization of any transition between any
 metastable states besides the slowest motion across the highest free energy
 barrier.
 The MSM eigenfunctions also entail important information on dynamical variables
, and could be projected onto the collective variable space to gain valuable
 insights on all possible variables corresponding to different processes
 in a chemical system.
 All of these benefits could be achieved with a relatively short simulation
 time; hence, MSM is an attractive tool among simulations in biochemical
 processes [CITE].
 Nevertheless, there are no MSM interpretations for processes governing
 the solution dynamics at all.
 Therefore, we hope to present the MSM interpretation of two model reactions
 for ionic association process of 
\backslash
ce{LiCl} and 
\backslash
ce{NaCl} in aqueous solutions.

MSM Ansatz
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In 1983, Zwanzig proposed that the transition between two metastable configurati
ons in the phase space can be treated as a continuous time random walk problem.
 [P-JStatPhys-1983-v30-Zwanzig] In order to understand the Markovianity
 of a MD trajectory, it is necessary to think about MD simulations in terms
 of the probability density of possible configurations, where the evolution
 of configurations over time is governed by generalized classical master
 equation for the distribution of the waiting times to change from one configura
tion to another.
 The short memory approximation of the transition memory kernels from the
 master equation can then be approximated, and it ignores the possibility
 of the later return to the same state.
 Hence, if the system's dynamics is sufficiently complex and metastable
 states are chosen sensibly, then this implies the memoryless characteristics
 of the interstate jumps.
 [P-JStatPhys-1983-v30-Zwanzig] 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As opposed to the typical view of the MD simulations as composed of distinct
 trajectories, MSM takes an ensemble approach given that the dynamics is
 ergodic in the phase space 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega$
\end_inset

, that is, there always exist a connected configuration to the current configura
tion in the phase space.
 Therefore, the evolution of the ensembles of the trajectories take a probabilis
tic approach in MSM.
 Since we assert that a transition from one configuration to another configurati
on after a lag time 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 is Markovian; therefore, starting from a configuration 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

 at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}\in\Omega$
\end_inset

, the probability that a trajectory starting at 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

 at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 will be in an infinitestimally small region 
\begin_inset Formula $d\mathbf{y}$
\end_inset

 around point 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{y\in\Omega}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $p(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y};\tau)$
\end_inset

 can be defined as, [CITE]
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y};\tau)d\mathbf{y}=\mathbb{P}[\mathbf{x}(t+\tau)\in\mathbf{y}+d\mathbf{y}|\mathbf{x}(t)=\mathbf{x}]
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Therefore, equation XX implies that for a set of configurations 
\begin_inset Formula $A\subset\Omega$
\end_inset

, the following also holds true for all configurations 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{y}\in A$
\end_inset

,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p(\mathbf{x},A;\tau)=\int_{\mathbf{y}\in A}p(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y};\tau)
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since the phase space 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega$
\end_inset

is ergodic, the state 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

 will be visited inifitely often as 
\begin_inset Formula $t\to\infty$
\end_inset

.
 Hence, a unique stationary probability density 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu(\mathbf{x})$
\end_inset

 can be written to represent this fact, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu(\mathbf{x})$
\end_inset

 represents the ensemble equilibrium density; for example, for a canonical
 (NVT) ensemble, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu(\mathbf{x})$
\end_inset

 can be written as,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mu(\mathbf{x})=\frac{\exp(-\beta H(\mathbf{x}))}{Z}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where 
\begin_inset Formula $Z=\int\exp(-\beta H(\mathbf{x}))d\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

 is the canonical partition function, 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta=(k_{B}T)^{-1}$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $H(\mathbf{x})$
\end_inset

 is a classical Hamiltonian of the system.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order for MSM to be a viable method to model reversible reactions, another
 assumption that the configuration 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}(t)$
\end_inset

 is reversible is needed.
 Therefore, the following detailed balance condition,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mu(\mathbf{x})p(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y};\tau)=\mu(\mathbf{y})p(\mathbf{y},\mathbf{x};\tau)
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
has to be satisfied.
 Thus, with conditions in equations XX to YY defined, we have formulated
 an ansatz for MSM.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Transfer Operator - MSM as an Eigenvalue Problem
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Considering a probability density of a configuration 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{t}(\mathbf{x})$
\end_inset

, the transition probability 
\begin_inset Formula $p(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{x};\tau)$
\end_inset

 governs that after some times 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

, the probability density of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

 at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t+\tau$
\end_inset

 is expressed as 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{t+\tau}(\mathbf{x})$
\end_inset

.
 Hence, one could define a propagator 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{Q}(\tau)$
\end_inset

 that satisfies the following properties,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p_{t+\tau}(\mathbf{y})=\mathcal{Q}(\tau)p_{t}(\mathbf{y})=\int_{\mathbf{x}\in\Omega}p(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y};\tau)p_{t}(\mathbf{x})d\mathbf{x}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When weighted by the stationary density, another way to look at equation
 XX is through the transfer operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{T}(\tau)$
\end_inset

 which propagates the weighted probability density 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{t+\tau}(\mathbf{y})$
\end_inset

.
 This, it must follow that,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
u_{t+\tau}(\mathbf{y})=\mathcal{T}(\tau)u_{t}(\mathbf{y})=\frac{1}{\mu(\mathbf{y})}\int_{\mathbf{x}\in\Omega}p(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y};\tau)\mu(\mathbf{x})u_{t}(\mathbf{x})d\mathbf{x}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In general, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{T}(\tau)$
\end_inset

 is a preferred operator because of the fact that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{T}(\tau)$
\end_inset

 operates on the weighted probability density.
 Therefore, it can be said that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{T}(\tau)$
\end_inset

 has to conform with the following properties,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{T}(\tau)$
\end_inset

 fulfills the Chapman—Kolmogorov equation 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{t+k\tau}(\mathbf{x})=[\mathcal{T}(\tau)]^{k}u_{t}(\mathcal{\mathbf{x}})$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $[\mathcal{T}(\tau)]^{k}$
\end_inset

 represents the 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

-th power of the transfer operator matrix.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
There exist eigenfunctions 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi_{i}$
\end_inset

 that corresponds to the eigenvalue problem 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{T}(\tau)\psi_{i}=\lambda_{i}\psi_{i}$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{i}$
\end_inset

 is the corresponding eigenvalue of an eigenfunction 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi_{i}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
\begin_inset Formula $\psi_{i}$
\end_inset

 relates to the 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

-th eigenfunction of the propagator 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{Q}(\tau)$
\end_inset

 through the stationary distribution; that is, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu(\mathbf{x})^{-1}\phi_{i}(\mathbf{x})=\psi_{i}(\mathbf{x})$
\end_inset

.
 Both 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{i}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi_{i}$
\end_inset

 share the same eigenvalue 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{i}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The eigenvalues 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{i}$
\end_inset

 are real numbers and 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{i}\in(-1,1]$
\end_inset

, and the first eigenvalue 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{1}$
\end_inset

 is always 1 and corresponds to the stationary density 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu(\mathbf{x})$
\end_inset

, and it must follow that 
\begin_inset Formula $1>\lambda_{2}\geq\lambda_{3}\geq\ldots\geq\lambda_{n}$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus, the weighted probability density 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{t+\tau}(\mathbf{x})$
\end_inset

 can be written as a sum of all the eigenfunctions of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{T}(\tau)$
\end_inset

, which represent the spectral decomposition of the dynamics in our system.
 All motions in the dynamics are thought of the superimposition of independent
 motions represent by the 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

-th eigenfunction.
 Hence, 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{t+k\tau}(\mathbf{x})$
\end_inset

 is now written as,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
u_{t+k\tau}(\mathbf{x})=\sum_{i=1}^{m}\lambda_{i}^{k}\left\langle u_{t},\psi_{i}\right\rangle _{\mu}\psi_{i}(\mathbf{x})+\sum_{j=m+1}^{\infty}\lambda_{j}^{k}\left\langle u_{t},\psi_{j}\right\rangle \psi_{j}(\mathbf{x})
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first term of equation XX represents 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 slowest motions which are deemed significant, while the second term represents
 all the other fast motions.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle u_{t},\psi_{i}\right\rangle _{\mu}$
\end_inset

 is simply the inner product between 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{t}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi_{i}$
\end_inset

 weighted by the stationary density 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu(\mathbf{x})$
\end_inset

.
 Equation XX also implies that in the limit where 
\begin_inset Formula $k\to\infty$
\end_inset

, only the first eigenfunction would remain as all other eigenvalues are
 strictly less than one except the first one, recovering the equilibrium
 distribution.
 The patterns of the eigenvalues thus would imply that for any motions where
 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{i}$
\end_inset

 is less than 1, all the terms where 
\begin_inset Formula $i>1$
\end_inset

 would decay over time according to the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{i}$
\end_inset

, which also determines the implied timescale of each motion through the
 following relationship,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
t_{i}=-\frac{\tau}{\ln\lambda_{i}}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Equation XX can thus be now written as,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
u_{t+k\tau}(\mathbf{x})=1+\sum_{i=2}^{m}e^{-\frac{k\tau}{t_{i}}}\left\langle u_{t},\psi_{i}\right\rangle _{\mu}\psi_{i}(\mathbf{x})+\sum_{j=m+1}^{\infty}e^{-\frac{k\tau}{t_{j}}}\left\langle u_{t},\psi_{j}\right\rangle _{\mu}\psi_{j}(\mathbf{x})
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The representation of 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{t+k\tau}(\mathbf{x})$
\end_inset

 outlined in equation XX is now separated into three parts; the stationary
 distribution, the 
\begin_inset Formula $m-1$
\end_inset

 important process that have distinctly different eigenvalues, from which
 the implied timescale of the process can now be extracted.
 However, important information can also be found from the first 
\begin_inset Formula $m-1$
\end_inset

 eigenfunctions as well through the projection onto the collective variable
 space, which we will discuss in the following section.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Approximating MSM Eigenfunctions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Approximation of the Eigenfunctions through Variational Principle
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The solution of an eigenvalue problem in equation XX gives us 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 eigenvalues and eigenfunctions that best approximates the probability of
 arriving at an MD configuration at time 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

after the current time.
 As mentioned in XX, the information provided by eigenvalues implies the
 inherent timescale of their corresponding eigenfunctions.
 However, the eigenfunctions themselves also contain several important dynamical
 information of the process of interest.
 We could see that the inner product 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle \psi_{i},\rho(\mathbf{x}_{i})\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 tells us about the projection of the probability density of the configuration
 at current time; thus, the eigenfunction 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi_{i}$
\end_inset

 with the highest eigenvalue contains the contributions that give rise to
 the slowest motion for this process.
 In a situation where we have 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{2}\gg\lambda_{i}\,\,\forall i>2$
\end_inset

, it readily implies that the slowest motion is a dominant motion and the
 other eigenfunctions decay much faster at lag time 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi_{2}$
\end_inset

 would be able to be taken to dominate the dynamics.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Equations XX and YY provided a spectral decomposition of all different motions
 in the system, where the information of each motion can be obtained from
 the eigenvalue problem 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{T}(\tau)\psi_{i}=\lambda_{i}\psi_{i}$
\end_inset

.
 The implied timescale of each process could also be obtained from the eigenvalu
es 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{i}=e^{-\frac{\tau}{t_{i}}}$
\end_inset

.
 However, we still do not know how to extract the dynamical information
 from the eigenfunctions.
 Nonetheless, equation XX implies that for any function that relates to
 a configuration 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

 at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

, the time-autocorrelation function of 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 as a function of 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 can be written as,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left\langle f(\mathbf{x}_{t})f(\mathbf{x}_{t+\tau})\right\rangle _{t}=\sum_{i=1}^{\infty}e^{-\frac{\tau}{t_{i}}}\left\langle \phi_{i},f\right\rangle ^{2}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hence, the time-autocorrelation function of the 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

-th normalized eigenfunction 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi_{i}$
\end_inset

 can be used to recover the 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

-th eigenvalue due to the fact that for a normalized eigenfunction, 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle \psi_{i}(\mathbf{x}_{t}),\psi_{i}(\mathbf{x}_{t+\tau})\right\rangle ^{2}=1$
\end_inset

.
 Thus, given that the eigenfunctions can be computed, the eigenvalues and
 the implied timescales can be approximated from the time-autocorrelation
 function as a function of 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

, now called a 
\shape italic
lag time
\shape default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\tilde{\lambda}_{i}=\left\langle \psi_{i}(\mathbf{x}_{t})\psi_{i}(\mathbf{x}_{t+\tau})\right\rangle 
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Nevertheless, the main question here is how would we know the eigenfunction.
 It is very likely that we will never know the true form of the eigenfunctions
 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi_{i}$
\end_inset

.
 However, since the eigenvalues 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{i}$
\end_inset

 can be modeled from the time-autocorrelation of 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi_{i}$
\end_inset

, we always know that for any model eigenfunction 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\psi_{i}}$
\end_inset

,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left\langle \tilde{\psi}_{i}(\mathbf{x}_{t})\tilde{\psi}_{i}(\mathbf{x}_{t+\tau})\right\rangle \leq e^{-\frac{\tau}{t_{i}}}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hence, the variational principle can be applied to find a good approximation
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\psi}_{i}$
\end_inset

 if we could find such a function that gives 
\begin_inset Formula $e^{-\frac{\tau}{t_{i}^{\ddagger}}}\approx e^{-\frac{\tau}{t_{i}}}$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{t}_{i}$
\end_inset

 is the approximation of the 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

-th implied timescale 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{i}$
\end_inset

.
 Since the equality between the modeled and the actual implied timescale
 only holds if 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\psi}_{i}=\psi_{i}$
\end_inset

, the modeled eigenfunction
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\psi}_{i}$
\end_inset

 that best approximates the true eigenfunction 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi_{i}$
\end_inset

 needs to maximize the modeled implied timescale 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{t}_{i}$
\end_inset

, or equivalently, maximize the modeled eigenvalue 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\lambda}_{i}$
\end_inset

.
 In fact, the principles behind the application of the variational principle
 to approximate the eigenfunctions of MSM is analogous to that of quantum
 mechanics, where the wavefunctions are best approximated by minimizing
 the energy.

\begin_layout Standard
Suppose that the modeled eigenfunction 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\psi}_{i}$
\end_inset

 can be modeled as a linear combination of an orthonormal basis of the ansatz
 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi_{k}$
\end_inset

, the reconstruction of 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\psi}_{i}$
\end_inset

 would take the following form,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\tilde{\psi}_{i}=\sum_{k=1}^{N_{\chi}}b_{ik}\chi_{k}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where the optimal set of coefficients 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{ik}$
\end_inset

 can be determined from solving the following eigenvalue problem,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mathbf{C}^{\chi}(\tau)\mathbf{b}_{i}=\mathbf{b}_{i}\lambda_{i}^{\ddagger}(\tau)
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{C}^{\chi}(\tau)$
\end_inset

 is the autocorrelation matrix of the ansatz functions at time 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

with the following form,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
c_{ij}^{\chi}(\tau)=\left\langle \chi_{i}(\mathbf{x}_{t})\chi_{j}(\mathbf{x}_{t+\tau})\right\rangle _{t}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
under the condition of orthonomal ansatz functions 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle \chi_{i},\chi_{j}\right\rangle _{\mu}=\left\langle \chi_{i}(\mathbf{x}_{t})\chi_{j}(\mathbf{x}_{t})\right\rangle =\delta_{ij}$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta_{ij}$
\end_inset

 is the Kronecker's delta.
 However, for a non-orthonomal basis of 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi$
\end_inset

, the basis must be orthonormalized first through generalizations of equation
 XX by using the autocorrelation of the ansatz function at time 0.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mathbf{C}^{\chi}(\tau)\mathbf{b}_{i}=\mathbf{C}^{\chi}(0)\mathbf{b}_{i}\lambda_{i}^{\ddagger}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Solving equation XX yields an optimal set of the coefficients 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{b}_{i}$
\end_inset

 for any non-orthonormal basis of 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi$
\end_inset

.
 In our case, since we would like to determine the optimal C.V.
 for a particular eigenfunction, we would then construct a basis of as many
 C.V.'s as possible and solve for equation XX for the coefficients.
 In order to properly obtain the autocorrelation function of the C.V., we
 need to subtract the mean of each C.V.
 from our data such that we have
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\xi_{i}^{MF}(\mathbf{x})=\xi_{i}(\mathbf{x})-\left\langle \xi_{i}(\mathbf{x})\right\rangle _{t}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Therefore, we can now write an approximation of the eigenfunction 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\psi}_{i}$
\end_inset

 as a linear combination of the mean-free C.V.'s 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi_{k}^{MF}$
\end_inset

,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\tilde{\psi}_{i}=\sum_{k=1}^{N_{\xi}}b_{ik}\xi_{k}^{MF}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In X.X.X, we have demonstrated that 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\psi}_{i}$
\end_inset

 can be approximated from the time-autocorrelation of itself at a lag time
 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

, and section Y.Y.Y demonstrates that 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\psi}_{i}$
\end_inset

 can be projected onto the collective variable space.
 However, one last question remains — how do we properly select the 
\begin_inset Formula $m-1$
\end_inset

 most important motions in the dynamics out of infinitely many possible
 motions? In order to achieve this, we need an algorithm that surely maximizes
 the time-autocorrelation 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle \tilde{\psi}_{i}(\mathbf{x}_{t})\tilde{\psi}_{i}(\mathbf{x}_{t+\tau})\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 so that the variational principle is optimally satisfied.

\begin_layout Subsection
Reduced Representation of Each IC with Matching Pursuit
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi_{i}^{\ddagger}$
\end_inset

 is expanded with a non-orthonormal basis, some of the C.V.'s may not be entirely
 independent.
 Thus, complicating the situation further by having coefficients in two
 or more possible C.V.'s that are not independent, and does not help us in
 achieving our goal to truly reducing the dimensionality expression of the
 chemical process of interest.
 Matching Pursuit algorithm (MP), first proposed by Mallat and Zhang [CITE
 LOOK AT FRANK NOTE], can help us achieve our goal by finding a sparse solution
 of equation XX and reassign the coefficients accordingly.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let us begin by suppose that there are 
\begin_inset Formula $m-1$
\end_inset

 model eigenfunctions 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\psi}_{i}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $2\leq i\leq m$
\end_inset

, are the most important components that we obtained from solving the TICA
 problem from the previous section.
 If we initially build such eigenfunctions from our library of 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 collective variables, then each 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\psi}_{i}$
\end_inset

 is simply a linear combination of those 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 variables as expressed in equation XX.
 However, as each 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\psi}_{i}$
\end_inset

 is a function of 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 variables, often times, it is very hard to use these variables altogether
 to discern the physical meaning of each 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\psi}_{i}$
\end_inset

.
 Preferably, one would prefer that each 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\psi}_{i}$
\end_inset

 has a physically meaningful representation with only dominant collective
 variables represented.
 The MP algorithm reduced the representation of 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\psi}_{i}$
\end_inset

 by finding only the productive coefficients that best summarize the behavior
 of the function based on our data.
 To better understand the MP algorithm, we would assume an arbitrary function
 
\begin_inset Formula $f(t)$
\end_inset

 that can be written as a linear expansion on a basis 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{\chi=\left\{ \chi_{1},\chi_{2},\ldots,\chi_{k}\right\} }$
\end_inset

that could either be orthonormal or not.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
f(t)=\sum_{i=1}^{k}b_{i}\chi_{i}(t)
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The inner product of 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 and a basis function 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi_{k}(t)$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle f,\chi_{k}\right\rangle $
\end_inset

, can be computed from the following equation,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\left\langle f,\chi_{k}\right\rangle  & =\sum_{i=1}^{n}b_{i}\left\langle \chi_{i},\chi_{k}\right\rangle \\
 & =\sum_{i=1}^{n}b_{i}c_{ik}^{\chi}(0)\\
 & =\sum_{i=1}^{n}c_{ki}^{\chi}(0)b_{i}\\
 & =\left(\mathbf{C}\mathbf{b}\right)_{k}
\end{align*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And a residual norm of 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\Vert f_{res}^{2}\right\Vert $
\end_inset

, is computed as follow,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\left\Vert f_{res}^{2}\right\Vert  & =\left\langle \sum_{i=1}^{n}b_{i}\chi_{i}(t)\sum_{j=1}^{n}b_{j}\chi_{j}(t)\right\rangle \\
 & =\sum_{i=1}^{n}\sum_{j=1}^{n}b_{i}b_{j}\left\langle \chi_{i}(t)\chi_{j}(t)\right\rangle \\
 & =\sum_{i=1}^{n}\sum_{j=1}^{n}b_{i}c_{ij}^{\chi}(0)b_{j}=\mathbf{b}^{T}\mathbf{C}\mathbf{b}
\end{align*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The algorithm to compute the productive coefficients, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{b}^{\ddagger}$
\end_inset

, of 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 is outlined in figure XX using 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle f,\chi_{k}\right\rangle $
\end_inset

and 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\Vert f_{res}^{2}\right\Vert $
\end_inset

 computed above.
 This presents an iterative method that converges to a set tolerance value
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\Vert f_{res}^{2}\right\Vert $
\end_inset

.
 The result of this algorithm is the reduced representation of 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $f^{\ddagger}$
\end_inset

such that,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
f^{\ddagger}(t) & =\sum_{i=1}^{n_{reduced}}b_{i}^{\ddagger}\chi_{i}(t)\\
 & \approx f(t)
\end{align*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{reduced}\leq n$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As shown in XX, TICA computes 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\psi}_{i}$
\end_inset

 according to the variational principle to get a best approximation that
 is reasonably close to 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi_{i}$
\end_inset

.
 Since TICA computes 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\psi}_{i}$
\end_inset

 as a linear projection onto the basis of collective variables, the MP projectio
n of 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\psi}_{i}$
\end_inset

 can be computed in the same fashion as equation XX, 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\psi_{i}^{\ddagger} & =\sum_{k=1}^{N_{reduced}}b_{ik}^{\ddagger}\xi_{k}^{MF}\\
 & \approx\tilde{\psi}_{i}
\end{align*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula $\psi_{i}^{\ddagger}$
\end_inset

 is now expressed as a linear combination of 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{reduced}\leq N_{\xi}$
\end_inset

 variables.
 Therefore, a reduced representation of 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi_{i}$
\end_inset

 would allow us to interpret the dynamics of each motion involving only
 important collective variables that are dominant in each specific 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi_{i}$
\end_inset

.
 This way, one could gain important mechanistic insights into the slowest
 dynamics in any kinds of systems.

Discretization of the Collective Variable Space

\begin_layout Standard
With all the formulations laid out in X.X, the TICA approximations of important
 
\begin_inset Formula $m-1$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi_{i}$
\end_inset

's can be computed and projected onto the collective variables space that
 we could begin with as large number of the collective variables candidates
 as possible.
 Consequently, we can now express the weighted probability density 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{t}(\mathbf{x})$
\end_inset

 in terms of 
\begin_inset Formula $m-1$
\end_inset

 dominant eigenfunctions, and 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{t}(\mathbf{x})$
\end_inset

 can then later be propagated with the transfer operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{T}(\tau)$
\end_inset

 to get the density for any time 
\begin_inset Formula $t+k\tau$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $k>0$
\end_inset

 is any positive integer.
 As MSM takes a probabilistic view of MD, the simulation data can then be
 projected onto the subspace consisting of 
\begin_inset Formula $m-1$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\psi}_{i}$
\end_inset

's.
 This could be achieved through discretization of the state space into the
 space of TICA eigenfunctions.

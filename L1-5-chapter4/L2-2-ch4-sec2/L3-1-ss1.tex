    \section{Gaussian Process Regression (GPR)}

    \subsection{Training Data as a Gaussian Process}

    Gaussian process regression (GPR) is a class of machine learning algorithms, where one aims to make a prediction of the relationship between 
    one set of input values to another set of output values based on the provided \textsl{training data} $\mathcal{D}$, which is a set of data 
    obtained from observations or experimental evidence. A set of the training data $\mathcal{D}$ with $N$ training examples is written as
    $\mathcal{D} = \left\{(\mathbf{x}_i,y_i)\right\}_{i=1}^N$, where $\mathbf{x}_i$ is a $1 \times D$ row vector called a \textsl{feature vector}
    containing $D$ features. The main objective of any machine learning algorithm is to recover an underlying relationship $f:\mathbb{R}^D\to\mathbb{R}$
    that maps $\mathbf{X} = \left[\mathbf{x}_1\,\mathbf{x}_2\,\ldots\,\mathbf{x}_N\right]^{\top}$ to $\mathbf{y} = \left[y_1\,y_2\,\ldots\,y_N\right]^{\top}$.
    The predicted form of $f$ would then be used to make a prediction in a \textsl{test set} with $N_{\mathcal{T}}$ entries
    $\mathcal{T} = \left\{(\mathbf{x}_i^*,y_i^*)\right\}_{i=1}^{N_{\mathcal{T}}}$ with an assertion that for any $\mathbf{x}_i^*,y_i^*\in\mathcal{T}$,
    each value of $y_i^*$ relates to $f(\mathbf{x}_i^*)$. Among the available machine learning algorithms, GPR is a subset of a class of algorithms
    called \textsl{Bayesian Concept Learning} \cite{B-MachineLearning-Murphy}, where the main concept is to compute a conditional expectation of $f$
    given a set of $\mathcal{D}$ based on Bayesian inference. The key idea behind GPR lies in the model that is used to interpret $\mathcal{D}$, 
    where each $y_i$ is not a perfect mapping of $\mathbf{x}_i$ by $f$, and each mapping $f(\mathbf{x}_i)$ differs from each $y_i$ by $\epsilon_i$,

    \begin{equation}
        y_i = f(\mathbf{x}_i) + \epsilon_i
        \label{eq:gpr-training-data-model}
    \end{equation}

    Equation \ref{eq:gpr-training-data-model}; therefore, represents the imperfection in the data collection procedures or inherent uncertainties
    in any algorithms or experiments, because each $\epsilon_i$ can be thought of as a statistical error of the $i$-th mapping of $f$. In GPR,
    the deviation $\epsilon_i$ is assumed to have a normal distribution,

    \begin{equation}
        \epsilon_i \sim \mathcal{N}(0,\sigma_{\epsilon_i}^2)
    \end{equation}

    To determine the underlying $f$ that maps $\mathbf{X}$ to $\mathbf{y}$, let us define a vector $\mathbf{f}$ where each element represents the 
    evaluation of some arbitrary function $f$ that we hope to represent the actual relationship we are looking for each $\mathbf{x}_i$,

    \begin{equation}
        \mathbf{f} = \left[f(\mathbf{x}_1)\,f(\mathbf{x}_2)\,\ldots\,f(\mathbf{x}_N)\right]^{\top}
        \label{eq:gpr-arbitrary-function-vector}
    \end{equation}

    If the elements of $\mathbf{f}$ in equation \ref{eq:gpr-arbitrary-function-vector} have a joint Gaussian distribution, then the function $f$
    that gives rise to the aforementioned property is said to be a Gaussian Process,

    \begin{equation}
        f \sim \mathcal{GP}\left(m(\cdot),k(\cdot,\cdot)\right)
        \label{eq:gpr-gaussian-process}
    \end{equation}

    \subsection{The Covariance Matrix}

    Equation \ref{eq:gpr-gaussian-process} states that $f$ is a Gaussian Process with mean $m$ and covariance $k$. For the purpose of approximating 
    the conditional expectation of $f$, the mean of this Gaussian Process is set to zero. The covariance of the Gaussian Process can be approximated 
    by a kernel where the key property of the covariance represents the correlation between two points in the feature space $\mathbf{x}_i$ and 
    $\mathbf{x}_j$. If the two points are identical, then the correlation should be at its maximum. If the two points are very far apart, then the 
    correlation is expected to decay towards zero, or no correlations at all. To satisfy this property, the most common choice of the covariance 
    approximation kernel is the squared exponential kernel $\mathbf{K}_{SE}$, which is a $ND \times ND$ matrix whose elements are defined as follow,

    \begin{equation}
        k_{ij} = \mathbf{K}(\mathbf{x}_i,\mathbf{x}_j) = \chi^2\exp\left(-\frac{1}{2}\sum_{a=1}^D\frac{\left(\mathbf{x}_i^{(a)} - 
            \mathbf{x}_j^{(a)}\right)^2}{{(\lambda^{(a)})}^2}\right)
        \label{eq:gpr-covariance-matrix}
    \end{equation}

    \noindent where $\chi$ represents the overall deviation of the function value in the region of interest, and $\lambda^{(a)}$ is called the 
    \textsl{length scale} in the $a$-th dimension. For a training data with $D$ dimensions, there are $D$ values of the length scales, each of 
    which controls how abrupt the correlation between the two points in the feature space should be in a specific dimension. Thus, if a dimension 
    has a small value of $\lambda^{(a)}$, it means that the value of the function should vary more rapidly in that dimension, and if a dimension 
    has a large value of $\lambda^{(a)}$, it means that the value of the function would vary slowly in that dimension. Equations
    \ref{eq:gpr-training-data-model} and \ref{eq:gpr-covariance-matrix} are, therefore, key ingredients to the GPR modeling of the test set, and 
    the success of such modeling would require a good set of $2D+1$ parameters containing $D$ values of $\sigma_{\epsilon_i}^2$, $D$ values
    of $\lambda^{(a)}$, and one value for $\chi$. These parameters are called the \textsl{hyperparameters} in machine learning literatures,
    and an optimum set of hyperparameters should result in a maximum likelihood $p(\mathcal{D}|\mathbf{y}^*,\mathbf{X}^*)$ that represents the best 
    fit to the training data. However, Stecher et al. suggested that hyperparameters optimization is a computationally expensive task, but one could 
    make a good choice of the hyperparameters from the \textsl{a priori} knowledge of our training data. Moreover, in the application for free energy surface 
    reconstruction, the range of good hyperparameters can vary at a large range while does not result in a significantly different reconstructed 
    free energy landscape. \cite{P-JCTC-2014-v10-Stecher}

    \subsection{Projection of a Two-dimensional Free Energy Landscape into One-di\-men\-sional Free Energy Landscape}

    If our $D$-dimensional free energy landscape is quantitatively sound, then its projection into each individual dimension needs to quantitatively 
    agree with the results we obtained from one-dimensional US simulations. In a two-dimensional scenario, the projection of the free energy into
    each individual variable is relatively easy. Define a free energy as a function of two collective variables $A(\xi_1,\xi_2)$. Therefore,
    we can write $A(\xi_1,\xi_2)$ in terms of the marginal probability density $p(\xi_1,\xi_2)$,

    \begin{equation}\begin{aligned}
        A(\xi_1,\xi_2) &= -\beta^{-1}\ln p(\xi_1,\xi_2) \\
                       &= -\beta^{-1}\ln\left[p(\xi_1)p(\xi_2|\xi_1)\right] \\
                       &= -\beta^{-1}\ln\left[e^{\left(-\beta A(\xi_1,\xi_2)\right)}p(\xi_2|\xi_1)\right]
        \label{eq:free-energy-projection-1}
    \end{aligned}\end{equation}

    The conditional probability $p(\xi_2|\xi_1)$ in the canonical ensemble can be written as,

    \begin{equation}
        p(\xi_2|\xi_1) = \frac{e^{-\beta A(\xi_1,\xi_2)}}{\int e^{-\beta A(\xi_1,\xi_2)} d\xi_2}
        \label{eq:conditional-prob}
    \end{equation}

    By plugging the expression for $p(\xi_2|\xi_1)$ from equation \ref{eq:conditional-prob} into equation \ref{eq:free-energy-projection-1},
    we can now express $A(\xi_1)$ by integrating out the elements in the $\xi_2$ dimension according to the following equation,

    \begin{equation}
        A(\xi_1) = -\beta^{-1}\ln\int e^{-\beta A(\xi_1,\xi_2)} d\xi_2
        \label{eq:projection-1}
    \end{equation}

    We could also repeat the similar procedures in equations \ref{eq:free-energy-projection-1} and \ref{eq:conditional-prob} to get $A(\xi_2)$,
    which is now written as,

    \begin{equation}
        A(\xi_2) = -\beta^{-1}\ln\int e^{-\beta A(\xi_1,\xi_2)} d\xi_1
        \label{eq:projection-2}
    \end{equation}

    Hence, both $A(\xi_1)$ and $A(\xi_2)$ from equations \ref{eq:projection-1} and \ref{eq:projection-2} can be used to compared with the US results
    to determine the quantitative agreement of GPR with respect to reference US free energy surfaces.

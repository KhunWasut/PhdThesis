    \subsection{UIFs Computation from a Biased WT-MTD Simulation}

    For any variants of metadynamics, the forms of the potentials similar to equations \ref{eq:metadynamics-potential} and 
    \ref{eq:wt-mtd-potential} are added to the normal potential that is the part of the original Hamiltonian of the system. Therefore, the 
    simulation with these added potential are biased, and the biased total potential for a WT-MTD simulation would have the following form,

    \begin{equation}
        V_{\mathrm{biased}}(\xi_1,\xi_2,\ldots,\xi_D,t) = V(\xi_1,\xi_2,\ldots,\xi_D) + V_{WT-MTD}(\xi_1,\xi_2,\ldots,\xi_D,t)
        \label{eq:biased-potential}
    \end{equation}

    \noindent where $V(\xi_1,\xi_2,\ldots,\xi_D)$ is the potential that is a part of the original Hamiltonian projected onto the collective
    variable space, and is invariant over time. $V_{WT-MTD}$ is defined in equation \ref{eq:wt-mtd-potential}. 

    Equation \ref{eq:uif-definition} outlines the expression of the UIF, which is the negative of the gradient of the original potential
    $V(\xi_1,\xi_2,\ldots,\xi_D)$. By taking the gradients of equation \ref{eq:biased-potential}, we can immediately see that

    \begin{equation}
        -\nabla_{\xi_j}V_{\mathrm{biased}} = -\nabla_{\xi_j}V - \nabla_{\xi_j}V_{WT-MTD}
        \label{eq:potential-gradients}
    \end{equation}

    Let $\phi_{\mathrm{biased}}(\xi_j) = -\nabla_{\xi_j}V_{\mathrm{biased}}$ and $\phi_{WT-MTD}(\xi_j) = -\nabla_{\xi_j}V_{WT-MTD}$, then 
    equation \ref{eq:potential-gradients} becomes,

    \begin{equation}\begin{aligned}
        \phi_{\mathrm{biased}}(\xi_j) &= \phi(\xi_j) + \phi_{WT-MTD}(\xi_j) \\
        \phi(\xi_j) &= \phi_{\mathrm{biased}}(\xi_j) - \phi_{WT-MTD}(\xi_j)
    \end{aligned}\end{equation}
\end{spacing}
